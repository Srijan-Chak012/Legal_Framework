It might delve into the unconventional use of wood in the medical field. It can also talk about how wood is used in general,

contamination, discussing the role of hygienists and the potential health risks.

Topic 20: Very similar to topic 19, seems very random and a mixture of several topics. However, terms such as patrol, 
alderin, cabbage, emission, mouse etc. give an indication towards the control and use of pesticides/insecticides. This is
further supported by usage of terms like land, valueless, fungi etc, which are consequneces of continuous and extensive 
usage of pesticides/insecticides
