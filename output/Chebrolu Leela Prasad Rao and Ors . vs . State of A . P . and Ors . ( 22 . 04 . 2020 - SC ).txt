Case Note:
Constitution - Reservation - Denial of - Government order issued directing posts of teachers in educational institutions in scheduled tribe areas shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes only - Another G.O. was issued to allow appointment of non-tribals to hold posts of teachers in scheduled areas till such time qualified local tribals were not made available - After that, non-tribals who were appointed as teachers in scheduled areas - Writ Petition was filed in High Court against termination of their services and same was allowed - In writ appeal, order of Single Bench was set aside by Division Bench - Non-tribal appointees preferred Civil Appeal before this Court, which was allowed - After this Court rendered decision, Government issued fresh notification providing for hundred percent reservation in respect of appointment to posts of teachers in scheduled areas - Tribunal set aside GOMs - Aggrieved thereby, writ petitions were filed in High Court, which upheld validity of G.O - Hence, present appeal - Whether notification providing for hundred percent reservation in respect of appointment to posts of teachers in scheduled areas was unconstitutional.

Facts:

By G.O. issued by the Governor in exercise of power under para 5(1) of Schedule V to the Constitution of India, directing the posts of teachers in educational institutions in the scheduled tribe areas shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes only notwithstanding anything contained in any other order or Rule or law in force. The Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal quashed the notification. The order was questioned in this Court which was dismissed as withdrawn. Another G.O. was issued to amend GOMs. to allow the appointment of non-tribals to hold the posts of teachers in the scheduled areas till such time the qualified local tribals were not made available. After that, non-tribals who were appointed as teachers in the scheduled areas. The Writ Petition was filed in the High Court against termination of their services. The same was allowed and GOMs. the advertisements were held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In writ appeal, the order of the Single Bench was set aside by the Division Bench. The non-tribal appointees preferred Civil Appeal before this Court, which was allowed. After this Court rendered the decision, the Government issued a fresh notification vide GOMs. effectively providing for hundred percent reservation in respect of appointment to the posts of teachers in the scheduled areas. The tribunal set aside the GOMs. Aggrieved thereby, writ petitions were filed in the High Court, which upheld the validity of G.O. The majority view opined that historically scheduled areas were treated specially, and affirmative action taken was in the constitutional spirit. The notification was a step for increasing literacy in the scheduled areas and also aimed at providing the availability of teachers in every school in the scheduled areas. The hundred percent reservation can be sustained on the ground that it was based on intelligible differentia, and the classification had nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The G.O. became necessary considering the phenomenal absenteeism of the teachers in the schools situated in the scheduled areas and was a step in aid to promote educational developments of tribals. In extraordinary situations, reservation could exceed fifty percent. The Governor possessed the power to issue the impugned notification under Schedule V, para 5(1) of the Constitution. The same overrides all other provisions of the Constitution, including Part III of the Constitution of India.

Held, while allowing the appeals:

(i) The exceptions and modifications were created by the law, which is already applicable in the area. It is not the formulation of a new law which is contemplated under Para 5(1) of Schedule V. No new law could be formulated while exercising power under Para 5(1) of Schedule V. The power of modification could not extend to re-writing the entire statute. The power could not be used to supplant the law, which was applicable. The law had to be applied only with exceptions or modifications. It could not totally supersede the existing law, which was wholly opposed to the idea of applicable law as in that case it would tantamount to the new law and not the modification or exception or creation of exceptions or modifications to the applicable law. The object and substance of law applicable cannot be changed within the purview of Para 5(1), though the applicability of applicable law could be excluded. In case the Governor decides the law to remain applicable, he had the power only to create exceptions and to modify the same, not to create a new one juxtaposed to the same applicable law. [49]

(ii) The A.P. Regulation of Reservation and Appointment to Public Services Act, 1997, deals with reservation in the State in the field of public services. G.O. did not amend the said Act. The provisions of the other Acts mentioned in the notification did not deal with the extent of reservation. Sections 78 and 79 of the A.P. Education Act, 1982 and Sections 169, 195, and 268 of the A.P. Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, were not related to reservation. The Rules were framed under the proviso to Article 309. They were not framed under the main provision by the legislature. The Governor in the exercise of power under Para 5(1) of Schedule V could have amended the Public Services Act, 1997, or direct it not to apply to Scheduled Areas. The creation of hundred per cent reservation had the effect of making a new law under Para 5(1) without reference to the Act of State or Central legislation. Independently of that power could not be exercised within the purview of Para 5(1) of Schedule V to the Constitution of India. Even otherwise, even if the Act of 1997 would have been modified by the Governor, hundred percent reservation could not have been provided. [50]

(iii) The Governor's power to make new law is not available in view of the clear language of Para 5(1), Fifth Schedule does not recognise or confer such power, but only power was not to apply the law or to apply it with exceptions or modifications. Thus, notification was ultra vires to Para 5(1) of Schedule V of the Constitution. [51]

(iv) The Rules framed under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution could not be said to be the Act of Parliament or State legislature. Though the Rules had the statutory force, they cannot be said to have been framed under any Act of Parliament or State legislature. The Rules remain in force till such time the legislature exercises power. The power of the Governor under Para 5(1) of Schedule V of the Constitution is restricted to modifying or not to apply, Acts of the Parliament or legislature of the State. Thus, the Rules could not have been amended in the exercise of the powers conferred under Para 5(1) of Schedule V. The Rules made under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution cannot be said to be an enactment by the State legislature. Thus, it was not open to the Governor to issue the impugned G.O. [57]

(v) The power was conferred on the Governor to deal with the scheduled areas. It was not meant to prevail over the Constitution. The power of the Governor was pari passu with the legislative power of Parliament and the State. The legislative power could be exercised by the Parliament or the State subject to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. The power of the Governor did not supersede the fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution. It had to be exercised subject to Part III and other provisions of the Constitution. When Para 5 of the Fifth Schedule confers power on the Governor, it was not meant to be conferral of arbitrary power. The Constitution could never aim to confer any arbitrary power on the constitutional authorities. They were to be exercised in a rational manner keeping in view the objectives of the Constitution. The powers were not in derogation but the furtherance of the constitutional aims and objectives. [78]

(vi) Considering the geographical disparity in public employment, Article 371D was inserted in the Constitution, providing candidates from certain districts/zones to form the local cadre for different posts for different parts of the States. The Presidential Order was issued providing district/zone for local cadre, on the other hand, the order issued by the Governor has reserved all the posts of teachers in the Scheduled Areas for Schedule Tribe candidates. The aspiring candidates of the district/zone in the Scheduled Area could not apply for the post of teachers in the district as hundred per cent reservation was made vide G.O. by the Governor. It was also not disputed that aspiring candidates cannot apply outside the district/zone because of the restrictions under Article 371D of the Constitution. As there was hundred per cent reservation provided for the Scheduled Tribes in the Scheduled Areas, other candidates of Scheduled Castes, General and Other Backward Classes category cannot apply at all in other districts. They were being denied the opportunity of getting the employment as against the posts in question. Thus, the order issued by the Governor was clearly in conflict with the Presidential Order issued under Article 371D. The candidates of local areas or other candidates except for Scheduled Tribes had been deprived of the opportunity of seeking public employment because of the order issued by the Governor, and they could not apply outside the local area in view of the Presidential notification. The Presidential notification intends that they had to apply within the district, and the Governor's notification takes away that right. Thus, there was a clear repugnancy between the notification issued by the President and that subsequent order issued by the Governor in the exercise of powers under Para 5, Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. It was not possible to harmonise both the notifications. Apart from that, there was total deprivation. It was not factually correct that Presidential Order did not deal with Scheduled Areas. The Presidential Order applied to the entire State and carved out a special provision that applies with a non-obstante clause. [89]

(vii) The Governor was competent to issue an order which is not in conflict with the Presidential Order. The Governor issued the order when the Presidential Order was already in force in the entire State. The Governor could not have issued the order in derogation to the Presidential Order. The hundred per cent reservation could not have been provided as that violates the Presidential Order. [90]

(viii) By providing hundred percent reservation to the scheduled tribes has deprived the scheduled castes and other backward classes also of their due representation. The concept of reservation was not proportionate but adequate, as held in Indra Sawhney. The action was thus unreasonable and arbitrary and violative of provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It also impinges upon the right of open category and scheduled tribes who have settled in the area. The total percentage of reservation provided for Scheduled Tribes in the State was six percent. By providing hundred percent reservation in the scheduled areas, the rights of the tribals, who are not residents of the scheduled areas, shall also be adversely affected. As per Presidential order under Article 371-D, they could not stake their claim in other areas. The posts in other areas are to be reduced by making a hundred reservation in a particular area. [127]

(ix) A reservation that was permissible by protective mode, by making it hundred percent would become discriminatory and impermissible. The opportunity of public employment could not be denied unjustly to the incumbents, and it was not the prerogative of few. The citizens had equal rights, and the total exclusion of others by creating an opportunity for one class was not contemplated by the founding fathers of the Constitution of India. Equality of opportunity and pursuit of choice under Article 51-A could not be deprived of unjustly and arbitrarily. As per the Presidential Order, the citizens of the locality and outsiders were entitled to fifteen percent of employment in the district cadre in terms of Clause 10 of Article 370(1) (d) of the Constitution. Thus, the G.O. did not classify but deals with reservations. It was contrary to the report sent to the President by the Governor, which indicated even the posts which were reserved for scheduled tribes teachers, they were not available as such Tribes Advisory Council decided to fill them from other non-local tribals. [134]

(xi) It was not in dispute that the district is a local area and a unit for the appointment of teachers and reservation is provided at the district level and as per the Presidential Order under Article 371D of the Constitution, incumbent of one district cannot stake claim outside the district for an appointment. The reservations for scheduled tribes are covered within the ken of Article 16(4). Thus, no further preference or classification could have been made under Article 16(1) of the Constitution of India in favour of scheduled tribes as Article 16(4) was exhaustive of the special provisions that can be made in favour of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes. Reservation for the other classes could be provided under Article 16(1) and not to scheduled tribes to whom the reservation had been provided under Article 16(4). Thus, as argued on behalf of Respondents, it could not be said to be a case of classification made under Article 16(1) of the Constitution of India. It was a case of tinkering with the percentage of reservation permissible as per the dictum of Indra Sawhney. Other incumbents who were in the reserved classes such as scheduled castes and other backward classes and even Scheduled Tribes who had settled after prescribed date beside incumbents of open category, were deprived of the right to stake claim to obtain public employment as against the posts in question. In the background of the discussion made in the earlier part of the judgment, it was crystal clear that the order passed providing hundred reservation was arbitrary, illegal, impermissible, and unconstitutional. [139]

(xii) The G.O. in question requires candidate or the parents to reside in the area. There was no rhyme or reason to require continuous residence for last fifty years or more. It overlooks the rights of various other persons who might have settled decades together in the area in question. It was discriminatory vis-Ã -vis to the scheduled tribes also settled in the area and it had no purpose to be achieved and imposes restriction which was not even provided in the Presidential Order issued under Article 371D of the Constitution of India with respect to residential or educational requirements. Thus, it did not lay down valid conditions. The same was fixed in highly unreasonable and arbitrary manner and limits zone of consideration to miniscule where an opportunity for public employment has to be afforded to all concerned with reasonable rights.

JUDGMENT
Arun Mishra, J.
1. In the reference, the validity of the Government Office Ms. No. 3 dated 10.1.2000 issued by the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh providing 100% reservation to the Scheduled Tribe candidates out of whom 33 1/3% shall be women for the post of teachers in the schools in the scheduled areas in the State of Andhra Pradesh, is under challenge.
2. Several questions have been referred for consideration in the order dated 11.1.2016. We have renumbered question Nos. 1(a)(b)(c) and (d) based on interconnection. The questions are as follows:
(1) What is the scope of paragraph 5(1), Schedule V to the Constitution of India?
(a) Does the provision empower the Governor to make a new law?
(b) Does the power extend to subordinate legislation?
(c) Can the exercise of the power conferred therein override fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III?
(d) Does the exercise of such power override any parallel exercise of power by the President Under Article 371D?
(2) Whether 100% reservation is permissible under the Constitution?
(3) Whether the notification merely contemplates a classification Under Article 16(1) and not reservation Under Article 16(4)?
(4) Whether the conditions of eligibility (i.e., origin and cut-off date) to avail the benefit of reservation in the notification are reasonable?
3. The facts in the backdrop project that by G.O. Ms. No. 275 dated 5.11.1986, issued by the Governor in exercise of power under para 5(1) of Schedule V to the Constitution of India, directing the posts of teachers in educational institutions in the scheduled tribe areas shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes only notwithstanding anything contained in any other order or Rule or law in force. The Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal (for short "the tribunal") quashed the notification by order dated 25.8.1989. The order was questioned in this Court in C.A. Nos. 2305-06/1991, which was dismissed as withdrawn on 20.3.1998.
4. Another G.O. Ms. No. 73 dated 25.4.1987 was issued to amend GOMs. No. 275 dated 5.11.1986 to allow the appointment of non-tribals to hold the posts of teachers in the scheduled areas till such time the qualified local tribals were not made available. After that, non-tribals who were appointed as teachers in the scheduled areas filed Writ Petition No. 5276/1993 in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad against termination of their services. The same was allowed vide judgment and order dated 5.6.1996 and GOMs. No. 73 dated 25.4.1987, and the advertisements were held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In writ appeal, the order of the Single Bench was set aside by the Division Bench vide judgment and order dated 20.8.1997. The decision in W.P. No. 16198/1988 thus prevailed. The non-tribal appointees preferred Civil Appeal 6437/1998 before this Court, which was allowed on 18.12.1998.
5. After this Court rendered the decision on 18.12.1998, the Government issued a fresh notification vide GOMs. No. 3 dated 10.1.2000 effectively providing for 100% reservation in respect of appointment to the posts of teachers in the scheduled areas. The tribunal set aside the GOMs. Aggrieved thereby, writ petitions were filed in the High Court, a 3-Judge Bench by majority upheld the validity of G.O. Aggrieved by the same, the appeals have been preferred.
6. The majority view opined that historically scheduled areas were treated specially, and affirmative action taken was in the constitutional spirit. The notification was a step for increasing literacy in the scheduled areas and also aimed at providing the availability of teachers in every school in the scheduled areas. 100% reservation can be sustained on the ground that it was based on intelligible differentia, and the classification has nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The G.O. became necessary considering the phenomenal absenteeism of the teachers in the schools situated in the scheduled areas and was a step in aid to promote educational developments of tribals. In extraordinary situations, reservation can exceed 50%. The Governor possessed the power to issue the impugned notification under Schedule V, para 5(1) of the Constitution. The same overrides all other provisions of the Constitution, including Part III of the Constitution of India.
7. The High Court in the minority view opined that providing 100% reservation for Scheduled Tribes in scheduled areas offends the spirit of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The Governor is not conferred power to make any law in derogation to Part III or other provisions of the Constitution of India in the exercise of his power under Clause I, Para 5 of Schedule V. It was also held that G.O. Ms. No. 3 is discriminatory as the same adversely affects not only the open category candidates but also other Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and backward classes. It also opined that the reservation Under Article 16(4) should not exceed 50%. However, little relaxation was permissible. The Rules made Under Article 309 of the Constitution could not be treated as an Act of Parliament or State Legislature.
8. G.O. Ms. No. 3 dated 10.1.2000, validity of which is questioned, reserved all posts in the educational institutions within the scheduled areas in favour of the local Scheduled Tribes. The order is extracted hereunder:
Whereas, under sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India, the Governor of Andhra Pradesh may by public notification direct that any particular Act of Parliament or of Legislature of the State shall not apply to the Scheduled Areas or any part thereof in the State or shall apply to a scheduled area or any part thereof subject to specified exceptions and modifications;
2. AND WHEREAS, in G.O. Ms. No. 275, Social Welfare Department dated 5.11.1986, a notification has been issued exercising the powers conferred under sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India directing that the posts of teachers in the Educational Institutions in the Scheduled Areas of State shall be filled in only by the local members of the Scheduled Tribes;
3. AND WHEREAS, the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal in its order dated 25.8.1989 in R.P. Nos. 6377 and 6379 of 1988 quashed the orders issued in G.O. Ms. No. 275, Social Welfare Department dated 5.11.1986 on the ground that the notification issued under sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Scheduled to the Constitution of India does not reflect the existence of either a State or a Central Legislation referable for issuing such notification;
4. AND WHEREAS, the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in its judgment dated 20-8-1997 in Writ Appeal No. 874 of 1997 filed by the Project Officer, I.T.D.A., Rampachodayaram, East Godavari District, directed to continue the Petitioners Respondents in their respective posts of teachers without any break as temporary employees until replaced by the qualified local tribals as and when such tribals are available to fill up those posts;
5. AND WHEREAS, the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal subsequently while disposing of O.A. No. 4598/97 in its order dt. 22.9.1997 directed the Respondents to follow the statutory Rules while making recruitment to the posts of Secondary Grade Teachers and also Telugu Pandits, Grade. I in Agency Areas without taking into consideration of the orders issued in G.O. Ms. No. 275, Social Welfare Department, dated 5.11.1986.
6. AND WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of India while allowing Civil Appeal No. 6437/98 in its order dated 18th December 1998, set aside the orders of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal on the ground that the State withdraw the appeals arising out of the S.L.P. Nos. 14562-63 of 1989:
7. AND WHEREAS, the Government considers that Rule 4 (b) of the Andhra Pradesh School Educational Subordinate Service Rules, 1992 and Rule 22A of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 shall be modified to the extent that only Scheduled Tribe Women shall be appointed in Scheduled Areas against 33 1/3% reservation in respect of direct recruitment;
8. AND WHEREAS, the consultation of the Tribes Advisory Council has been made as required under sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
9. AND WHEREAS, the Government of Andhra Pradesh in order to strengthen the educational infrastructure in the Scheduled Areas, to promote educational development of Tribals, to solve the phenomenal absenteeism of Teachers in the Schools situated in Scheduled Areas and with a view to protect the interests of local tribals have decided to reserve the posts of teachers in favour of local Scheduled Tribes candidates;
10. AND WHEREAS, the Government considered to re-issue the said orders retrospectively from 5.11.1986 keeping in view the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of Fifth Schedule to the Constitution;
11. The following notification will be published in part-IV-B Extraordinary issue of the Andhra Pradesh Gazette, dated 10.1.2000.
NOTIFICATION
In exercise of the power conferred by subparagraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India and in Supersession of the notification issued in G.O. Ms. No. 275, Social Welfare Department, dated the 5th November 1986, as subsequently amended in G.O. Ms. No. 73, Social Welfare Department, dated the 25th April 1988, the Governor of Andhra Pradesh hereby directs that Sections 78 and 79 of the Andhra Pradesh Education Act, 1982 (Act 1 of 1982) and Sections 169, 195 and 268 of the Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 (Act 13 of 1994) and Rule 4 (a) of the Andhra Pradesh School Educational Subordinate Service Rules issued in G.O. Ms. No. 538 Education (Ser. II) Department, dated the 20th November 1998 and Rule 22 and 22A of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 and any other Rules made in this regard shall apply to the appointment of posts of teachers in schools situated, in the Scheduled areas in the State subject to the modification that all the posts of teachers in the Schools situated in Scheduled Areas in the State of Andhra Pradesh shall be filled in by the local Scheduled Tribe candidates only out of whom 33 1/3% shall women.
EXPLANATION: For the purpose of this notification, the 'Local Scheduled Tribe Candidate' means, the candidate belonging to the Scheduled Tribes notified as such Under Article 342 of the Constitution of India and the candidates themselves or their parents have been continuously residing in the scheduled areas of the Districts in which they are residents till to date since the 26th January 1950.
9. In the notification various provisions have been mentioned. Section 78 of the A.P. Education Act, 1982 provides for the constitution of educational service. It confers power upon the Governor to make Rules to regulate the classification, methods of recruitment, conditions of service, pay and allowances and discipline and conduct of the members of the educational service. Section 79 inter alia deals with dismissal, removal, reduction in rank and suspension of the employees of private institutions. Section 169 of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 deals with creation of the posts of officers and employees of the Mandal Parishad, the method of recruitment and conditions of service. Section 195 of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, provides for creation of posts of officers and employees of Zilla Parishad, the method of recruitment, conditions of service, etc. Section 268 of the said Act empowers the Government to make rules.
10. The Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 referred to in the notification were made by the State in exercise of the power conferred under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. Rule 22 of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 provides for reservation. Rule 22 is extracted hereunder:
Special Representation (Reservation): (1) Reservation may be made for appointments to a service, class or category in favour of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes, Women, Physically handicapped, Meritorious Sportsman, Ex-Servicemen and such other categories, as may be prescribed by the Government from time to time, to the extent and in the manner specified hereinafter in these Rules or as the case may be, in the special rules. The principle of reservation as hereinafter provided shall apply all appointments to a service, class, or category.
(i) by direct recruitment, except where the Government by a General or Special Order made in this behalf, exempt such service, class or category;
(ii) otherwise than by direct recruitment where the special Rules lay down specifically that the principle reservation in so far as it relates to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only shall apply to such services, class, or category to the extent specified therein.
(2)(a) The unit of appointments for the purpose of this Rule shall be one hundred vacancies, of which, fifteen shall be reserved for scheduled for Scheduled Castes, six shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes, twenty-five shall be reserved for the Backward Classes and the remaining fifty-four appointments shall be made on the basis of open competition and subject to Rule 22-A of these rules.
(e) Appointments under this Rule shall be made in the order of rotation specified below in a unit of hundred vacancies.
Rule 22-A: Women reservation in appointments: Notwithstanding anything contained in these Rules or special Rules or Ad hoc Rules:
(1) In the matter of direct recruitment to posts for which women are better suited than men, preference shall be given to women:
Provided that such absolute preference to women shall not result in total exclusion of men in any category of posts.
(2) In the matter of direct recruitment to posts for which women and men are equality suited, there shall be reservation to women to an extent of 33 1/3% of the posts in each category of Open Competition, Backward Classes (Group-A), Backward Classes (Group-B), Backward Classes (Group-C), Backward Classes (Group-D), Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Physically Handicapped and Ex-Servicemen quota.
(3) In the matter of direct recruitment to posts which are reserved exclusively for being filled by women, they shall be filled by women only.
Six per cent reservation has been provided in the State for Scheduled Tribes.
11. The A.P. Regulation of Reservation and Appointment to Public Services Act, 1997, was enacted to ensure that the reservation mandated Under Rule 22 is followed scrupulously. The Act intended to punish the officers for violation of the Rules of reservation. The Act did not provide any percentage of the reservation to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and the backward classes. The reservations were provided Under Rules 22 and 22A of the Rules framed Under Article 309.
ARGUMENTS
12. It was submitted by Mr. C.S.N. Mohan Rao, Mr. G. Ramakrishna Prasad and Mr. G.V.R. Choudhary, learned Counsel and other learned Counsel for the Appellants that the limited legislative power is conferred on the Governor to modify the existing legislation made by the Parliament or the State legislature under Para 5(1) of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. The power to make Regulation was conferred under Para 5(2) of Schedule V. Under Para 5(1), there is no such legislative power. The earlier G.O. Ms. of 1986 was quashed. After that, the appeal preferred in this Court was withdrawn, and fresh G.O. was issued, again perpetuating the illegality by providing a 100% reservation.
13. Learned Counsel for the Appellants argued that Article 371-D of the Constitution contains special provisions concerning the State of Andhra Pradesh, which has now been amended for Andhra Pradesh as well as Telangana. After re-organisation of the States, the Article has been amended in its application to Andhra Pradesh as well as Telangana. Article 371D was promulgated given the geographical disparities in the arena of public employment in the State of Andhra Pradesh as candidates from certain districts were capturing a disproportionately large number of posts, as such by way of the Presidential Order issued under the said provisions, local cadres were created for different parts of the State. The Presidential Order provided for reservation on district/zonal basis for different posts. A district/zone as the case may constitute a local area. A district is a unit for teachers, and all the posts have been ordered to be filled by scheduled tribe candidates in the scheduled areas in several districts.
14. Learned Counsel for the Appellants argued that as per the Presidential Order issued Under Article 371D, aspiring candidates could not apply outside the district or zone, as the case may be. Thus, the incumbents cannot apply outside their districts where they are residing. Their chances of obtaining public employment as against the posts of teachers have been taken away. Thus, the G.O. transgresses the Presidential Order issued Under Article 371-D of the Constitution as such the same is unconstitutional and could not prevail.
15. Learned Counsel for the Appellants further argued that providing 100% reservation is not permissible because of the catena of decisions rendered by this Court, to be referred later. Learned Counsel vehemently argued that it is an unfortunate reality that the lawmakers are resorting to reservations on political basis catering to vote-bank, thereby ignoring the constitutional mandate to which they owe allegiance. The reservation so provided is against the wishes of the founding fathers of the Constitution. The reason employed of chronic absenteeism in the schools, could not have been made the fulcrum justifying 100% reservation. Merit has been ignored and whittled down. The noble profession of teaching cannot be demeaned. There cannot be a compromise with the standard of education in the garb of cent percent reservation, and merit is a casualty. It tantamounts to reverse discrimination. It cannot be said to be a case of classification, but it is a case of reservation. It is highly unfair and unreasonable action. The Constitution of India does not permit 100% reservation in respect of any particular class or category to the total exclusion of others. Reservation set out Under Article 16 should not exceed the limit of 50%.
16. The G.O. would be counter-productive to the aim of the Constitution in providing protective legislation, and the main thrust of the reservation is to bring in the disadvantaged classes into the mainstream of the society at large. The idea of the tribal students to be taught by tribal teachers in the scheduled areas is akin to compromising with the merit and quality of education and further put the tribal children at a disadvantage and segregate them from the mainstream. Regarding the language barrier, learned Counsel argued that qualifications for teachers could be provided that they should know the local language, a resident of a district invariably knows the local language. In the impugned notification, no such aspect was mentioned.
17. Learned Counsel on behalf of the Appellants further argued that Rules 22 and 22A of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 provides for reservation framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. The legislature did not frame them. Thus, it could not have been amended or modified by the Governor in exercise of the power under Para 5(1) of Schedule V to the Constitution being subordinate legislation. That apart, it was argued that no new law could have been created within the realm of Para 5(1) of Schedule V. The Acts mentioned in G.O. Ms. No. 3/2000 did not deal with reservation. The Act of 1997, provided for the reservation, was not amended. Even by amending the same, 100% reservation could not have been provided.
18. The classification created within the scheduled tribes to benefit only the candidates or their parents continuously residing in the scheduled areas since 26.1.1950 is arbitrary, illegal, and discriminatory vis-à-vis the scheduled tribes also, besides other categories. The executive order could not have provided the reservation. The legislation was imperative to provide for a 100% reservation. Testing the case on the anvil of the doctrine of basic structure is not germane as it is not a case set up that provisions under Para 5 of Schedule V are against the basic structure of the Constitution. The provisions of Para 5 of Schedule V are not questioned, but only the legality of the action taken thereunder. The right of judicial review is available in case of any action taken, which is per se illegal, arbitrary or violative of fundamental rights and sans any basis.
19. Concerning the non-obstante clause, it was argued that the order under Para 5 of Schedule V could not have been issued in contravention of Article 371D. It contravened the Presidential order.
20. Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondents, argued that the Constitution has a solicitude for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes under various provisions contained in Articles 15 and 16 and the Directive Principles contained in Articles 37, 38, 47 and 51(A). There are special provisions carved out providing reservation to SCs/STs; there is National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, Article 330 provides reservation of seats for SC/ST in House of People, Article 332 provides reservation in State Assemblies, Article 335 provides to consider the claim of SCs/STs to services, Article 338 provides for the constitution of National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Article 338A provides for the constitution of National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Articles 339, 341, 342 and 334, are other provisions relating to SCs/STs. Articles 343D and 343(T)(h) provide reservation for SC/ST in Panchayats.
21. Learned Senior Counsel further argued that India's Constitution is symmetrical and spatial for SCs/STs. In that view, the scheduled areas are constituted under the provisions of Article 244 and Schedules V and VI. The Constitution creates special classification. Equality is a concept of anti-arbitrariness. The normal Rule of 50% reservation can be relaxed in appropriate cases that have precisely been done by the Governor. Reservation can be made by executive order. Reservations cannot be termed to be anti-meritarian. He urged that the reservations were provided due to discrimination, disadvantage, and to share the State power. Elaborately referred to the decision in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., MANU/SC/0104/1993 : (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217, it was argued that reservations could be rectified/revised. It is not permissible to sub-divide the SCs and STs. Article 16(4) aims at group backwardness. Strictly speaking, the constitution of a Commission to enquire is not necessary for providing further reservations, particularly for scheduled tribes in the scheduled areas. The scope of judicial review is limited in such matters. He referred to various dictums to be adverted to later.
22. Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned Senior Counsel, lastly argued that G.O. Ms. No. 3/2000 is constitutionally valid, and the Court may, if so advised, issue directions to the States to maintain oversight. The purposes of Article 371D and Para 5 of Schedule V are entirely different. He further argued that to trickle down the necessary benefits, the remedy lies in following what is inelegantly called the "bottoms up" approach. The malady can be addressed by empowering Gram Sabhas, ensuring the right to information, and strengthening its implementation. Learned Senior Counsel alternatively argued that in case this Court concludes that the G.O. is to be quashed, the appointments made should not be disturbed.
23. Shri R. Venkataramani, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Andhra Pradesh, argued that the scheme of Schedule V, as a whole, deserves to be dealt with on a special constitutional footing, that is an exclusive constitutional enclave, free in its ambit to ensure the promotion of the interests, concerns and the development of scheduled areas. Paras 2 and 5 of the Fifth Schedule constitute its essence. Para 2 enacts limitations on the executive power of the State concerning the scheduled areas. Para 5 is a composite and particular species of the enabling power, conferring on the Governor, legislative, and administrative powers. The legislative and administrative powers run seamlessly. For instance, the power under Clause (1) of Para 5 to extend a Central or State legislation to the scheduled area, "subject to exceptions and modifications," confer a power to amend the legislation. The power under clauses (1) and (2) operates in distinct fields to achieve distinct purposes, each of them wide in their way. The object to be achieved under Clause (1) is to evaluate and assess the relevance, fitness, or inappropriateness of any law in their application to scheduled areas, the domain of policy with considerable latitude to bring into force with modifications and exceptions any law.
24. Shri R. Venkataramani, learned Senior Counsel further argued that the scheduled areas and the tribes constitute a special class. This special homogenous class can always be dealt with on a special basis. The G.O. was not issued to favour the local scheduled tribes or to discriminate against others intentionally. It was passed to advance the educational interests of the scheduled areas, even if it otherwise impinges upon the claims Under Article 14 or 16(1), cannot be faulted. Even if the G.O. advances a class interest, it cannot be subjected to scrutiny Under Articles 14 and 16(1).
25. Shri R. Venkataramani further argued that there is no conflict between Article 371D and Schedule V. The two operate in distinct fields and achieve different purposes. The socio-economic experiments drafted by the legislatures, and in this case by the Governor, cannot be subjected to judicial scrutiny. It is wrong to suggest that the non-obstante Clause in Article 371-D can annul the non-obstante Clause in Para 5 of the Fifth Schedule. Firstly, the two constitutional provisions operate in distinct domains. Article 371-D was not enacted to be a superimposition on Schedule V. Secondly, it is well settled that if the object and purpose of legislation or provisions with respective non-obstante clauses are distinct, the Court would not see any conflict.
26. Shri R. Venkataramani, learned Senior Counsel, also argued that Schedule V is a complete Code by itself. It is not a case of reservation at all. It is a classification made to ensure that the schools in the scheduled areas function and promote the educational interest of the tribal populace. The Governor took cognizance of the general non-availability of teachers. The notification by prescribing that the Scheduled Tribe teachers of the local areas should be the exclusive component of the teaching element was looking at the local scheduled tribe teacher as the best possible tool for ensuring the educational interest of the scheduled areas. Learned Senior Counsel has referred to various decisions, to be adverted later.
27. Learned Senior Counsel further pointed out that the scheduled area is extended over 31,485 sq. km. which is about 11% of the total area of the State with more than 5938 villages distributed in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Khammam, Warangal, Adilabad and Mahaboobnagar Districts. Scheduled Tribe students are at a disadvantageous position. The non-attendance of teachers was more in the scheduled areas, so to provide the facility of teaching, classification has been made. It cannot be said to be a case of providing reservations. The Government of Andhra Pradesh, Department of Tribal Welfare, has established various categories of educational institutions to cater to the needs of Scheduled Tribes children in the State.
28. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Department of Tribal Welfare, established various categories of educational institutions to cater to the needs of Scheduled Tribes children in the State, such as Gurukula Pathasalas, Ashram schools, and residential, educational institutions, and the method of appointment of the local tribe has yielded good results.
29. Shri B. Adinarayana Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Telangana, pointed out the history of scheduled areas Ganjam and Vizagapatnam. The Act of 1839 declared agency areas of Madras Presidency, providing for separate administration of tribals/agency areas. In 1874, the Scheduled Districts Act, XIV was passed, which had a Schedule in which the territories were mentioned, inhabited by tribals as such. Rules were issued for administering the areas by the Governor General-in-Council to the exclusion of ordinary laws. The Government of India Act, 1919, had made "wholly excluded and partially excluded areas for reform" and kept them under the administration of Governor General-in-Council, with a separate application of laws. The Government of India Act, 1935, had extended the same. Thus, historically, the scheduled areas were governed by special laws. They cannot be compared with areas generally administered by the Act of legislatures. Special provisions have been made in Schedule V. The order issued by the Governor has to be treated as legislation. The application of laws is one of the recognised forms of legislation. The order of Governor can only be tested on the parameters of competence and violation of the Constitution. It cannot be tested on the touchstone of ideal norms. It achieves the purpose of Article 46 of the Constitution.
30. Shri B. Adinarayana Rao, learned Senior counsel, has further argued that forests or hills separate scheduled areas from other areas. Notified tribes inhabit them. There are some non-tribals in the scheduled areas. In spite of their stay/residence, the non-tribals cannot acquire by sale, purchase, lease, or otherwise, the lands in the scheduled areas and legislations imposing such restrictions have been held to be constitutional by this Court in various decisions. The tribal customs, culture, traditions, and personal laws need to be protected and preserved. They speak their dialect in their habitations. Due to inaccessibility and lack of facilities, the teachers appointed in scheduled areas are not attending the schools, leading to chronic absenteeism. The experiment has resulted in fulfilling the desired objectives. There has been a significant increase in literacy among tribals.
There is no repugnancy with the Presidential Order issued Under Article 371D. Article 371D(10) provides for the non-obstante Clause to make the provisions immune from challenge Under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The provisions made in Para 5 of Schedule V have to be viewed on a similar anvil.
31. Shri Shivam Singh, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of some of the Respondents, argued that the basic structure doctrine is inapplicable, the original constitutional text must not be employed to test the impugned action. Schedule V Under Article 244(1) of the Constitution is part of the original text. Hence, it must not be tested on the touchstone of the basic structure violation. He argued by referring to the decisions of this Court that the constitutional amendments post-1973 can be struck down if they violate the basic structure doctrine and not the original text of the Constitution. The non-obstante Clause in Para 5(1) Schedule V continues to hold and occupy the field. The rigours of the basic structure doctrine may hit Article 371-D but cannot affect Schedule V Article 14 cannot be used to defeat intendment of the non-obstante Clause of Schedule V.
32. Shri Shivam Singh, learned Counsel, further argued that in case of conflict between non-obstante clauses, as far as possible, they must be harmoniously construed. The provision enacted later prevails over the one enacted earlier. If the latter provision is found to be generic as against the earlier provision, then the earlier provision has to prevail.
33. Learned Counsel has further canvassed that as the Governor has the power to frame the regulations, the power extends to subordinate legislation also. Subordinate legislation has to be treated as part of the legislation itself. Regulations must be treated as part of the statute itself. In the power to modify and create exceptions in exceptional circumstances to provide a 100% reservation is permissible. There is minimal scope for judicial review. The notification contemplated a classification Under Article 16(1) not a reservation Under Article 16(4) issued to provide impetus to scheduled areas in the field of education; to strengthen educational infrastructure, to promote the educational development of tribals; to prevent phenomenal absenteeism of teachers in the schools in the scheduled areas from teaching tribals. The conditions of eligibility and cut-off date to avail the benefit of reservation are reasonable to further strengthen the educational infrastructure development and other problems faced in the area.
