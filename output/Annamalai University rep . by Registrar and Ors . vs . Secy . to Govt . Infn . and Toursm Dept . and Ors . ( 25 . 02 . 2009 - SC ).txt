JUDGMENT
S.B. Sinha, J.
1. Interpretation and application of the University Grants Commission (the minimum standards of instructions for the grant of the first degree through non-formal/distance education in the faculties of Arts, Humanities, Fine Arts, Music, Social Sciences, Commerce and Sciences) Regulations, 1985 (for short, "1985 Regulations") framed by the University Grants Commission (for short, "UGC") in exercise of its powers conferred by Clause (f) of Sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (for short, "the UGC Act") vis-à-vis the provisions of the Indira Gandhi National Open University Act, 1985 (for short, "the Open University Act") is in question in these appeals. They arise out of a common judgment and order dated 4.2.2008 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Appeal Nos. 1221 of 2005 and 82 of 2006 and Writ Petition No. 36307 of 2004.
2. Indisputably, N. Ramesh (Ramesh) and Sibi Madan Gabriel (Gabriel) were candidates for appointment to the post of Principal in Film and Television Institute (for short, "the Institute") of Tamil Nadu. Gabriel was appointed temporarily as a `Lecturer in Acting' in the Institute on or about 26.5.1982. His services were regularized with retrospective effect from the date of his joining by an order dated 20.2.1992. He was subsequently promoted as Head of Section by G.O.Ms. No. 236 dated 17.8.1993. The next avenue of promotion from the post of Head of Section is the post of Principal in the Institute. In the year 2000, Ramesh was given the additional charge to the post of Principal. Gabriel filed an Original Application before the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal (for short, "the Tribunal"), which was marked as O.A. No. 5275 of 2000 questioning the legality of the said appointment on the ground that Ramesh did not have the requisite essential educational qualification for the post of Principal.
3. The Tribunal, by its judgment and order dated 14.8.2000, directed the State to consider the objections of Gabriel having regard to the qualifications prescribed for the said post vis-à-vis those possessed by Ramesh. The challenge to the qualification of Ramesh was that he did not possess a basic graduation degree and, thus, the post-graduation degree conferred on him by appellant - University is invalid in law. At that stage, the State appointed one Mr. K. Loganathan, which was challenged by Ramesh by way of O.A. No. 2085 of 2003 before the Tribunal. Said application was dismissed by the Tribunal by reason of an order dated 5.1.2004. Ramesh challenged the said order of the Tribunal by filing a writ petition marked as Writ Petition No. 841 of 2004, which had become infructuous as after retirement of said Mr. K. Loganathan, Ramesh was appointed as the Principal by order dated 6.12.2004. Gabriel challenged the said appointment of Ramesh by filing Writ Petition No. 36307 of 2004.
4. Indisputably, during the pendency of the said writ petition, Gabriel filed W.M.P. No. 43649 of 2004 for stay, which was granted. Ramesh filed W.V.M.P. No. 2428 of 2004 for vacating the stay which was rejected by the learned single judge by order dated 21.6.2005. Writ appeals were preferred there against by Ramesh as also State Government and the Director of Information and Public Relation, which were marked as Writ Appeal No. 1221 of 2005 and Writ Appeal No. 82 of 2006. By reason of judgment and order dated 14.2.2006, while allowing the writ appeals, writ petition preferred by Gabriel was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court.
5. Indisputably, the said decision of the Division Bench of the High Court had been challenged in this Court by way of Civil Appeal No. 3178 of 2007, which by reason of a judgment and order dated 20.7.2007 was disposed of by remanding the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration observing that UGC as well as appellant - University should be impleaded as parties in the writ petition.
6. Indisputably, the post of Principal in the Institute is governed by Rules made under the proviso appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. Rule 4 lays down the qualifications for the said post, which reads as under:
7. Indisputably, Ramesh holds a diploma in Film Technology. He also has the requisite experience of five years as Head of Section. He, however, has obtained M.A. Degree in Open University System (OUS) in an examination held by the appellant - University.
8. The Division Bench of the High Court by reason of the impugned judgment allowed the writ petition and disposed of the writ appeals pending before it holding that Ramesh was not eligible to be considered for the post of Principal as the M.A. Degree obtained by him through OUS, without there being a first (Bachelor's) degree, was not a valid one. Consequently, the State was directed to take steps to fill up the post of Principal in accordance with law.
9. Aggrieved thereby and dissatisfied therewith, the University as also Ramesh are before us.
10. Mr. K. Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant - University would submit:
i. The system of imparting education between a conventional University and an Open University being different and being governed by the UGC Act and the Open University Act respectively, the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment.
ii. Regulations framed by the UGC both providing for the eligibility to seek admission to the Masters' degree as also information required to be furnished thereabout by the State Universities to the UGC, the later must be held to have relaxed the conditions as no direction in that behalf has been communicated to the University. In any event, as Distance Education Council (DEC) of IGNOU, being an authority constituted under Statute 28 of the Open University Act, having granted post-facto approval to the courses of studies of the University by a letter dated 21.7.2008 this Court should set aside the impugned judgment.
iii. In view of the decision of this Court in Guru Nanak Dev University v. Sanjay Kumar Katwal and Anr. reported in MANU/SC/8135/2008 : (2009)1SCC610 , the decision of the High Court has been rendered erroneous as therein Master's degree under the OUS by the appellant - University has been held to be valid stating that although one University is entitled not to recognize the said degree as an equivalent to the qualification it may have prescribed for eligibility to a higher course.
iv. Regulations framed by UGC in any event being in conflict with the Open University Act must be held to be ultra vires the same particularly in view of the fact that Sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Open University Act provides for a non-obstante clause. In any event, Open University Act being a later enactment and both statutes having been passed by the Parliament, the provisions of Open University Act would prevail over the UGC Act.
v. In any view of the matter as from 1995 till 2005 several persons have received degrees issued by the University and if they are disqualified at this stage, a large number of persons would suffer irreparable injury, this Court should issue appropriate directions in this behalf.
11. Mr. R.V. Kameshwaran, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant - Ramesh would contend:
i. Having regard to the provisions of the UGC Act and in particular Section 27 thereof providing for delegation of power to the authority, and as a Notification dated 1.3.1995 has been issued directing that the degrees issued by the Universities would stand automatically recognized for the purpose of employment to posts and services under the Central Government subject to approval of the DEC, IGNOU, the High Court must be held to have committed a serious error in holding contra.
ii. From various correspondences, it would appear that the UGC Regulations were amended only in the year 2003 and the Master's degree awarded upto 30.6.1989 were treated to be valid.
iii. Many established Universities like that of Annamalai University across the country, having conducted such courses under OUS and such degrees having been accepted by Public Service Commission, the High Court's judgment even in equity should be set aside.
12. Mr. G.E. Vahanwati, learned Solicitor General who appeared at the request of the Court would contend that from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of Open University Act it is evident that the Parliament made a distinction between formal and non-formal education and UGC Act being concerned with formal education, IGNOU and particularly the DEC had the requisite jurisdiction to lay down syllabus as also duration of such courses.
13. Mr. Amitesh Kumar, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the UGC would urge:
i. Regulations framed by the UGC being statutory in nature and in any event the constitutionality of the said Regulations having not been challenged, the High Court's judgment must be held to be wholly sustainable.
ii. In view of the fact that the Vice-Chancellor and the Chairman DEC of IGNOU having accepted in its letter dated 5.5.2004 that the UGC Regulations shall prevail, the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants must be held to be wholly misconceived.
iii. As Regulations framed by the UGC are required to be laid before the Houses of the Parliament in terms of Section 28 of the Act and furthermore the Ministry of Human Resource Development being a Nodal Ministry of both UGC as also IGNOU, the Regulations having been made at its instance, cannot be said to be subservient to the provisions of the Open University Act.
iv. UGC having the requisite jurisdiction inter alia to lay down the minimum standard, Regulations framed by it are binding on all Universities and, thus, it would not be correct to contend that Open University Act shall prevail over the regulations framed by the UGC.
14. Mr. B.D. Sharma, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioners - respondents submitted that the purported ex post facto recognition of the M.A. degrees granted by the DEC is wholly without jurisdiction. There being no conflict between the UGC Act and the Open University Act in respect of laying minimum standard, the question declaring the regulations ultra vires of the Open University Act does not arise.
15. Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India reads thus:
66. Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions.
`Education' is also in the Concurrent List; Entry 25 whereof reads as under:
25. Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour.
The Central Government as also the State Governments in exercise of their legislative competence in terms of Entry 25 are entitled to make legislations. Pursuant thereto, and in furtherance thereof, Universities like IGNOU had been enacted by the Parliament again in exercise of its legislative competence in terms of Entry 25. UGC Act, on the other hand, comes within the purview of Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. It was enacted to make provision for the co- ordination and determination of standards in Universities and for that purpose, to establish a UGC.
UGC was established by the Central Government in terms of Section 4 of the UGC Act. Powers and functions of the Commission have been laid down in Chapter III thereof. Section 12 provides for functions of the Commission; some of the relevant provisions whereof are:
12. It shall be the general duty of the Commission to take, in consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned, all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co- ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and research in Universities, and for the purpose of performing its functions under this Act, the Commission may--
...
(d) recommend to any University the measures necessary for the improvement of University education and advise the University upon the action to be taken for the purpose of implementing such recommendation;
...
(i) require a University to furnish it with such information as may be needed relating to the financial position of the University or the studies in the various branches of learning undertaken in that University, together with all the rules and regulations relating to the standards of teaching and examination in that University respecting each of such branches of learning;
