JUDGMENT

1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam dated 19.7.2007 delivered in Writ Appeal No. 2038 of 2001.
3. The short question that arises for consideration of this Court is whether the High Court was justified in ignoring the report of the Medical Board in which it is clearly mentioned that disability of A.V. Damodaran was neither attributable nor aggravated by the military service.
4. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of the appeal are as under:
A.V. Damodaran was enrolled in the Indian Army as Sapper in the Madras Engineers Group on 28.11.1979. After completion of basic training he was posted to 1st Engineer Regiment.
5. A.V. Damodaran was admitted to MI Allahabad and was diagnosed to be suffering from "Malaria" B.T." on 24.6.1984. He was discharged from the hospital on 30.6.1984 and was again admitted in the Air Force Hospital, Jhansi because he was suffering from "Hallucination". A.V. Damodaran was transferred to the Command Hospital, Lucknow for management by a psychiatrist on 5.7.1984. The disability of A.V. Damodaran was diagnosed as "Schizophrenia (295)" in peace station in July 1984.
6. On 17.1.1985 the Medical Board recommended him to be invalided out of service in medical category "EEE" with 60% disability for a period of two years due to the disease "Schizophrenia (295)". The Medical Board had opined that the disability of A.V. Damodaran was not attributable to the military service nor has it been aggravated thereby and it is not connected with the service, as Schizophrenia is a constitutional disease. The opinion of the Medical Board reads as under:
OPINION
This is a case of Schizophrenia in a young officer with 5 yrs. service with disorder of though perception, behavior and irrational incongruity. He also exhibited impairment of judgment and insight. Onset July 84, he has been treated with neuroleptis, electroplexy and psychotherapy. Response to therapy has been satisfactory. There is no evidence of active present features of illness at present.
However, in view of early onset of the illness, a short period of service and chances of relapse in future under stress and strain of military service, he is considered unfit for further service. Recommended medical category EEE (Psychological).
He has been reviewed by the medical specialist and no physical contributory factor elicited for his psychiatric breakdown. In abetment assessed is 60% (sixty percent) disability neither attributable nor aggravated by service. Longevity: Average
11.1.85. AFMSF 16281 along with related documents.
7. The legal representatives of respondent No. 1 herein filed an Original Writ Petition before the High Court praying for grant of disability pension. By an order dated 20.12.2000 the learned Single Judge has allowed the original petition and declared that the individual was eligible to get disability pension under the provisions contained in the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 and such other enabling provisions. The Department filed a Writ Appeal before the High Court. By an impugned order, the High Court has dismissed the said appeal finding no reason to interfere with the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge.
8. The main questions of law that arise for consideration of this Court are as under:
i) Whether the High Court is justified in upholding the order passed by the learned Single Judge granting disability pension to the respondents and dismissing the Writ Appeal by the appellant?
ii) Whether the respondents are entitled to the grant of disability pension under the provisions as contained in Regulation 173 of the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 and such other enabling provisions?
9. The appellant Union of India submitted that:
a) As per the medical opinion the respondent A.V. Damodaran was examined by the medical specialist and no physical contributory factor elicited for his psychiatric breakdown. In disablement assessed is 60% (sixty percent) disability neither attributable nor aggravated by service.
b) The respondent's personal history reveals that he joined army in 1979 to secure a good job. He is unmarried and supporting his family. He is having no addiction to any intoxication. Field Service is Nil and Punishment is Nil.
c) It is submitted that Discharge Certificate was prepared and issued to the respondent by the Commanding Officer of his parent Unit upon his release from the service. Therefore, original discharge certificate is not available with the Department. The copy of discharge certificate presently available with the Department is one which was forwarded by the respondent along with his representation dated 18.3.1986 submitted by him to the Department. Hence, the authenticity of the discharge certificate cannot be relied upon and taken into account for grant of disability pension. In any event, in view of the Medical Board held on 17.1.1985, it is erroneous.
d) In the present case, the Medical Board held on 17.1.1985 at Command Hospital (Central Command), Lucknow, consisting of specialized Doctors had opined that the disability of the respondent is neither attributable nor aggravated by the Military service and it is not connected with the service, but it was constitutional in nature. The said opinion is binding on all the concerns and is the only document on the basis of which disability pension can be granted or refused.
10. The appellant, aggrieved by the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court, preferred this appeal.
11. The appellant relied upon the judgment of this Court in Controller of Defence Accounts (Pension) and Ors. v. S. Balachandran Nair MANU/SC/1188/2005 : (2005) 13 SCC 128. In that case, a reference made under Rule 173 of the Pension Regulations for the Army has also been discussed. Rule 173 of the Pension Regulations for the Army reads as under:
173. Primary conditions for the grant of disability pension.--Unless otherwise specifically provided a disability pension may be granted to an individual who is invalided from service on account of a disability which is attributable to or aggravated by military service and is assessed at 20 per cent or above.
