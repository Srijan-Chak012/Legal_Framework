Prior History:
From the judgment and order dated 28th November 1969 of the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Revision Case Nos. 635 and 636 of 1969--
Case Note:

Criminal - application of law - word gold covers not only which is lawfully possessed but any of its form or shape - it is clear that prohibition in regard to manufacture of article of gold would apply to even smuggling gold and it would not be defence for dealer - it is clear if any gold is acquired declaration has to be made in that regard.
JUDGMENT
Y.V. Chandrachud, J.
1. These appeals are brought by leave granted by the High Court of Calcutta under Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution.
2. Cr. A. No. 114 of 1970: On May 29, 1968 gold bars and sovereigns bearing foreign markings were seized from the respondents by customs officers, Calcutta. Respondents were charged under Section 135, Customs Act, 1962 for being in possession of goods which they had reason to believe to be liable to confiscation under Section 111 of that Act. It was alleged that the goods were imported into India without the requisite permit and without payment of duty and were therefore liable to confiscation under Section 111(d) of the Customs Act. The respondents were also charged under Rules 126P(1)(i) and 126P(2)(ii) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, for failure to make a declaration in respect of the gold found in their possession.
3. The respondents pleaded guilty to the charges but cited facts in extenuation of the offences. The learned Presidency Magistrate, 8th Court, Calcutta, convicted them of the offences of which they were charged but he directed, on the faith of a report made by the Probation Officer, that they should be released under Section 4(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 on their executing a bond of Rs. 1000/- each with one surety in like amount, undertaking to appear and receive the sentence whenever called upon and to keep peace and be of good behavior for a period of two years. Respondents are young boys normally engaged in agriculture. To us they seem to be carriers who were carrying the gold for a small tip but the learned Magistrate believed their defence that they had purchased the gold for the marriage of the sister of one of them. The gold which was of the value of about Rs. 7800/- was already confiscated in the proceedings under the Customs Act.
4. The appellant, an Assistant Collector of Customs, filed on behalf of the Department a revision application (No. 635 of 1969) in the High Court of Calcutta against the judgment of the learned Magistrate. Later, it was converted into an appeal under Section 11(2) of the Probation of Offenders Act.
5. The High Court disposed of three matters by a common judgment which is reported in Aravinda Mohan Sinha v. Prohlad Chandra Samanta MANU/WB/0083/1970 : AIR1970Cal437 Two out of these are before us; the third, Criminal Appeal No. 113 of 1970 is reported to be unready. The High Court held in the matter under consideration that though Rule 126PP(2)(ii) of the Defence of India Rules prescribes a minimum sentence of imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months", it cannot override the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act and therefore it was competent to the learned Magistrate to release the respondents under that Act.
6. The only question in this appeal is whether the Probation of Offenders Act, 20 of 1958, can apply to offences under the Customs Act, 1962 and to those under Part-XII-A of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, intittled "Gold Control".
7. Section 135(b)(ii) of the Customs Act, 1962, under which the respondents have been convicted prescribes a punishment of 2 years imprisonment or fine or both for acquiring possession of or for being in any way concerned in carrying, keeping etc. any goods which a person knows or has reason to believe to be liable to confiscation under Section 111. Under Section 111(d), goods imported contrary to any prohibition imposed by or under the Customs Act or by any other law are liable to confiscation. The offence committed by the respondents consists in their being in possession of or in purchasing the gold bearing foreign markings which was evidently imported into India without a valid permit issued by the Reserve Bank of India, an act prohibited by Section 8(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. On the prosecution leading evidence to establish the ingredients of this offence, respondents pleaded guilty to the charee.
8. Rule 126P(1)(i) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962 provides to the extent material that whoever omits or fails to make a declaration as required by Rule 126 I without a reasonable cause shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or a fine or with both. The relevant part of Rule 126 I provides that every person shall within the specified period make a declaration to the Administrator in the prescribed form as to the quantity of gold, other than ornaments owned by him. Rule 126P (2)(ii) provides that whoever has in his possession or under his control any quantity of gold in contravention of the provisions of Part XII-A ("Gold Control"), shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and also with fine. Respondents had made no declaration of the gold in their possession and pleaded no reasonable cause for omitting to do so. They pleaded guilty to these charges as well.
9. The Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, received the assent of the President on May 16, 1958 and was published in the Gazette of India on May 19, 1958. Section 3 of the Act confers power on the court to release certain offenders after admonition. Under Section 4(1):
When any person is found guilty of having committed an offence not punishable with death or imprisonment for life and the Court by which the person is found guilty is of opinion that, having regard to the circumstances of the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to release him on probation of good conduct, then, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Court may, instead of sentencing him at once to any punishment, direct that he be released on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence when called upon during such period, not exceeding three years, as the Court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behavior.
10. We are unable to accept the appellant's contention that the probation of Offenders Act can have no application to offences consisting of the contravention of the Customs Act or the "Gold Control" Rules contained in Part XII-A of the Defence of India Rules, 1962. True, that these offences are fundamentally of a different genre and are calculated to involve consequences of a far reaching character as compared with offences under the general law of Crimes. These are mostly economic offences which in conceivable cases may pose a grave threat to the economy and the security of the country. But every contravention of the Customs Act or the "Gold Control" Rules cannot, without more, be assumed to be fraught with consequences of national dimensions. The broad principle that punishment must be proportioned to the offence is or ought to be of universal application save where the statute bars the exercise of judicial discretion either in awarding punishment or in releasing an offender on probation in lieu of sentencing him forthwith.
