ORDER
1. A three-Judge Bench consisting of one of us by judgment dated March 12, 1985, reported in MANU/SC/0043/1985 : [1985]3SCR169 made a detailed order regarding the working of the lime stone quarries in the Dehradun-Mussoorie belt. The quarries in that area were classified into three categories being A, B and C. In regard to the C grade quarries, this Court ordered:
We are clearly of the view that so far as the lime stone quarries classified in category C in the Bhargav Committee Report are concerned which have already been closed down under the directions of the Bhargav Committee, should not be allowed to be operated. If the lessees of these lime stone quarries have obtained any stay order from any court permitting them to continue the mining operation, such stay order will stand dissolved and if there are any subsisting leases in respect of any of these lime stone quarries they shall stand terminated without any liability against the State of Uttar Pradesh. If there are any suits or writ petitions for continuation of expired or unexpired leases in respect of any of these lime stone quarries pending, they will stand dismissed.
