Case Note:
Property - Allotment - Present Appeal was against order of High Court set aside order of Single Judge and quashing allotment made in favour of Academy - Whether High Court was right in quashing allotment made in favour of Academy.

Facts:

Appellant-Academy, an educational institution, initially was situated on a Wakf property in Jammu. Vide order of authority constituted under J&K Wakf Act, 1978, said educational institution was ordered to be evicted from Wakf property. Against said order, Academy approached Jammu & Kashmir Special Tribunal, and an interim order of stay on eviction was granted by tribunal. During interregnum, Academy made representations to State Government requesting for allotment of a piece of land at any placementioned in representations for shifting and running school. In a meeting dated 28th June, 2000, a decision was taken by J & K Housing Board in pursuance of orders of Chief Minister, that two kanals of land would be allotted to Academy at the rate of Rs. 8,00,000 per kanal and other two kanals free of cost. Further, in a Cabinet meeting, it was decided that, Jammu Development Authority was to be compensated for free allocation of land in form of allotment of alternate land to Authority. Allotment of land to Academy was sanctioned. Academy finally paid a total of Rs. 16,00,000 for two kanals of land and obtained two more kanals free of cost. A lease deed was executed, and possession was handed over. Academy constructed the school building thereon and school was being run on this premises, having shifted from wakf property. Residents of Channi Himmat vide Writ Petition questioned the allotment made in favour of Academy, on ground that piece of land was meant for a playground but same was allotted to Academy in violation of original scheme and plan of Channi Himmat Housing Colony. Division Bench by impugned judgment set aside order of Single Judge and allowed writ petitions and consequently quashed allotment made in favour of Academy.

Held, while allowing the appeals

1. Articles 38 and 39 of the Constitution of India provide that the State must strive to promote the welfare of the people of the State by protecting all their economic, social and political rights. These rights may cover means of livelihood, health and the general well-being of all Sections of the people in the society, of which education is an important aspect. [8]

2. Imparting basic education is a constitutional obligation on the State as well as societies running educational institutions. Children are the future of our nation. Education is a basic tool for individuals to lead an economically productive life and is one of the most vital elements for the preservation of the democratic system of government. The Constitution of India bestows considerable attention to the field of education. It recognizes the need for regulating the various facets of activity of education and also the need for not only establishing and administering educational institutions but also providing financial support for educational institutions run by private societies. [9]

3. Thus, State Government proceeded to allot the land in favour of Appellant keeping in mind the public interest in education of hundreds of children as well as considering urgency of matter and it could not be said that, action was not backed by a social or welfare purpose. Test of Article 14 must be applied from perspective of substantive rather than formal equality, and must be mindful of effect of action or Rule that was being tested. While under ordinary circumstances, usual practice of allocation of sites on basis of advertisements or auction was being followed, instant situation warranted a deviation from standard procedure to prevent prejudicing future of children studying at Academy. Taking a holistic view of matter, action taken by State Government did not suffer from vice of arbitrariness insofar as it was backed by a welfare purpose. [9]

4. In addition, there was no reason to reject contention of State Government that, allotment of 4 Kanals of land to Appellant was in nature of an exchange, as State Government wanted to evict Appellant who was running a school at Wakf land situated in main city area. Such a decision seemed to have been taken by State Government to avoid any unrest in locality or city. In such circumstances, there was no arbitrariness in decision taken by State in allotting 4 Kanals of property. On other hand, action of State was fair, reasonable, transparent, unbiased, without favouritism and nepotism. [10]

5. Action of authorities could be assailed to extent that, allotment of two kanals free of cost was bad in law. It was evident that, consideration paid by Appellant was only with respect to two kanals and the remaining two kanals of land were allotted for free to the Appellant. It was not in dispute that Rs. 8,00,000 per kanal was average auction sale price which was fetched around time of allotment. In view of figure in mind, State Government fixed allotment price at Rs. 8,00,000 per kanal. There was no arbitrariness in fixing price at Rs. 8,00,000 per kanal. However, Supreme Court was unable to accept contention that, allotment of 2 Kanals of land for free was justified. This was all more significant in light of absence of any material on record to show that, school was being run purely for charitable and educational purposes.

6. The aforementioned observations suggest that while in the case of a non profit-oriented educational institution serving the public interest, public property can be allotted to it at a concessional price or for free by imposing stringent conditions for the use of the land, it is questionable whether the same can be done for profit-oriented institutions. [12]

7. Thus, there was a loss to public exchequer to extent of Rs. 16,00,000 for two kanals as on date of allotment. However, having regard to fact that, Appellant-Academy had been running on allotted site since many years, after constructing a new building, transfer might be saved by giving transferee an opportunity to make good shortfall in consideration. [13]

8. It was appropriate to give Appellant opportunity to make good shortfall in consideration, as loss to public exchequer caused by free allocation could not be said to have had an everlasting effect or impact on public interest. Moreover, there was no high-handedness on part of Appellant in seeking allotment in its favour, as it acted in a bona fide manner. Public must be adequately compensated for the alienation of natural resources by the State. [14]

9. Therefore, Appellant should pay consideration for two kanals of land received gratuitously, at the rate of Rs. 8,00,000/- per kanal, which was average auction price prevailing at time of allocation. Appellant was also liable to pay interest at rate of 6% per annum from date of allotment till date of payment. [15]

Appeals allowed, impugned judgment passed by Division Bench was set aside and judgment of learned Single Judge was restored, with the aforementioned modification. [16]

Appeal Allowed
JUDGMENT
Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.
1. The judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir at Jammu in L.P.A. (OW) No. 38/2008 and L.P.A. (OW) No. 39/2008 dated 01.04.2009 is the subject matter of these appeals.
2. The brief facts leading to these appeals are that the Appellant-J.S. Luthra Academy (hereinafter referred to as the 'Academy'), an educational institution, initially was situated on a Wakf property in Jammu. Vide order dated 27.12.1995 of the authority constituted under the J&K Wakf Act, 1978, the said educational institution was ordered to be evicted from the Wakf property. Against the said order, the Academy approached the Jammu & Kashmir Special Tribunal, and an interim order of stay on eviction was granted by the tribunal on 09.01.1996. During the interregnum, the Academy made representations to the State Government requesting for allotment of a piece of land at any place mentioned in the representations for shifting and running the school. The concerned minister in the meeting dated 14.1.1998 considered the question of allotment of land in favour of the Academy. Subsequently, a note was prepared by the Managing Director of the J & K Housing Board on 25.1.1999, proposing that the Board had 4 kanals of land in Sector 2 of Channi Himmat, Jammu earmarked for schools which could be considered for allotment to the Appellant at Rs. 8,00,000/- per kanal. In a subsequent meeting on 29.4.1999 after completion of formalities, four kanals in Sector 2 of Channi Himmat were allotted to the Academy at Rs. 8,00,000/- per kanal on lease for 40 years and the Academy was directed to deposit 50% of the said amount, the remaining amount to be deposited subsequently. In a meeting dated 28.6.2000, a decision was taken by the J & K Housing Board in pursuance of the orders of the Chief Minister, that two kanals of land would be allotted to the Academy at the rate of Rs. 8,00,000/- per kanal and the other two kanals free of cost. Further, in a Cabinet meeting dated 18.8.2000, it was decided that the Jammu Development Authority was to be compensated for the free allocation of land in the form of allotment of alternate land to the Authority. The allotment of land to the Academy was sanctioned by the Principal Secretary, Government of J&K, vide letter dated 24.8.2000. The Academy finally paid a total of Rs. 16,00,000/- for two kanals of land and obtained two more kanals free of cost. A lease deed was executed, and possession was handed over on 12.12.2001. The Academy constructed the school building thereon and the school is being run on this premises, having shifted from the wakf property.
3. The residents of Channi Himmat vide Writ Petition No. 1093 of 2002 questioned the allotment made in favour of the Academy, on the ground that the piece of land was meant for a playground but the same was allotted to the Academy in violation of the original scheme and plan of the Channi Himmat Housing Colony. One Mr. Naresh Kumar, a proprietor of the United Public School situated at Channi Himmat, filed a writ petition being O.W.P. No. 10/2003, questioning the allotment made in favour of the Academy on the ground that the property ought to have been auctioned by the Government, so that he could have also applied for the allotment of the plot, which he required for the upgradation of his school to the higher secondary level. Both the writ petitions were clubbed, heard and decided together by the learned Single Judge of the High Court and were dismissed. However, the Division Bench by the impugned judgment set aside the order of the Single Judge and allowed the writ petitions and consequently quashed the allotment made in favour of the Academy with the following observations:
The board is directed to hold public auction of the land for the purpose of leasing the same out on the same terms and conditions it had leased it to the private Respondent, except that the premium thereof shall be fixed at the highest price to be obtained at such auction to be held by inviting people interested in setting up of a secondary school on the plot of land in question by publishing at least two advertisements in newspapers widely circulated in Jammu and also published therefrom. The Board is directed to fix the minimum bid price at Rs. 16.00 lacs plus the cost of construction ascertained in the manner as above. In the event the bid to be had at the public auction does not exceed the minimum reserved bid price, the Board shall execute a fresh lease in favour of the private Respondent upon obtaining payment of Rs. 16.00 lacs from him. In the event the bid price to be had at the auction exceeds the minimum reserved bid price and the same is not given by the private Respondent, the Board shall give an opportunity to the private Respondent to meet the same and, if he meets the same, to execute the lease in favour of the private Respondent upon accepting the amount of such bid, less the cost of construction ascertained in the manner as above, as premium. In the event the private Respondent fails to match the bid price, the Board shall grant the lease in favour of the highest bidder and from the amount so to be received, first pay the cost of construction ascertained in the manner as above to the private Respondent.
4. The contesting Respondents herein, i.e., the original writ Petitioners who were before the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench, have chosen to remain absent before this Court despite service of notice on them. Heard the learned Counsel for the Academy, the State and the Housing Board. Learned Counsel for the Academy taking us through the material on record submitted that the allotment of the site was done following due procedure. The Academy was asked to vacate the wakf property, where it was running the school earlier, since the wakf wanted the property for its personal purposes. As the school was catering to the needs of hundreds of students and as it was being run successfully, the Managing Committee of the Academy did not want to close the academy, inasmuch as the closure would have been detrimental to the interests of the students. The Cabinet being competent to allot the land had duly considered the matter and had taken the decision on 18.8.2000 to allot the land to the Appellant keeping in mind the plight of the students and urgency of the matter inasmuch as the school had to be shifted at an early date. The sum and substance of the argument of the Academy, the State and the Housing Board is that the allotment was made keeping in mind the public interest at large and the personal interest of any personality involved in running the Academy was not given any importance at all.
5. Learned Advocate for the State of Jammu and Kashmir submitted that the allotment of 2 Kanals of land to the Appellant free of cost was a policy decision of the Government inasmuch as such allotment was in the nature of an exchange for eviction of the Appellant, who was running a school on the Wakf land in the main city area. The object was twofold, firstly, to ensure continuity of the school/public purpose, and secondly, to expeditiously evict the Appellant from the wakf land and consequently, free such land from prolonged litigation. He further submitted that neither was there any violation of any policy for allotment of land to educational institutions in the State of Jammu and Kashmir at the relevant time, nor was there any loss caused to the State qua the 2 Kanals of land (out of total 4 Kanals of land) that was allotted to the Appellant. Under such facts and circumstances of the case, he argued that the judgment of this Court in the case of Institute of Law Chandigarh v. Neeraj Sharma, MANU/SC/0841/2014 : (2015) 1 SCC 720 wherein the allotment of land to an educational institution without inviting competitive bidding was cancelled is distinguishable on two counts:
a) At para 32 of the judgment, the Development authority was found not to have adhered to the applicable policy, i.e. the allotment of land to Educational Institutions (Schools), etc. on lease hold basis in Chandigarh Scheme, 1996 for allotment of land.
b) At Para 17 of the judgment it is recorded that the audit department of the UT Chandigarh Administration found that the allotment caused a loss of Rs. 139 crores to the public exchequer.
Lastly, he submitted that the allotted land was earmarked for schools and playfields in the Master Plan and hence, there was no violation of the Master Plan in allotment of land to the Appellant.
6. This Court in a series of cases including Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India, 2012 3 SCC 1 (popularly known as the "2G case"), in Natural Resources Allocation, In Re. Special Reference No. of 1/2012, MANU/SC/0793/2012 : (2012) 10 SCC 1, Manohar Lal Sharma v. Principal Secy., MANU/SC/0727/2014 : (2014) 9 SCC 516, Bharti Airtel Limited v. Union Of India, MANU/SC/0613/2015 : (2015) 12 SCC 1, and Goa Foundation v. Sesa Sterlite Ltd., MANU/SC/0087/2018 : (2018) 4 SCC 218 has formulated the guidelines for allocation of natural resources by the State. In Bharti Airtel Ltd. v. Union of India, MANU/SC/0613/2015 : (2015) 12 SCC 1, this Court summed up the principles governing the allocation of natural resources by the State laid down in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India, MANU/SC/0089/2012 : (2012) 3 SCC 1 ("the 2G case") as follows:
41. The licensor/Union of India does not have the freedom to act whimsically. As pointed out by this Court in 2G Case [Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India, MANU/SC/0089/2012 : (2012) 3 SCC 1] in the above-extracted paragraph, the authority of the Union is fettered by two constitutional limitations:
firstly, that any decision of the State to grant access to natural resources, which belong to the people, must ensure that the people are adequately compensated and, secondly, the process by which such access is granted must be just, non-arbitrary and transparent, vis-à-vis private parties seeking such access.
