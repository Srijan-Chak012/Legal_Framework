ORDER
1. Heard learned Counsel for the parties as also the learned Solicitor General of India, Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, who has appeared as amicus curiae.
2. This Appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Kerala High Court dated 24th June, 2004 in Writ Petition No. 30845 of 2003.
3. The Writ Petition was filed by the Council of Principals of Colleges in Kerala, which is an association of Principals of various private aided colleges in the State of Kerala. The main challenge in the writ petition before the High Court was that the various universities in the State of Kerala had issued directions by way of letters/circulars to conduct election to the colleges' unions. The challenge in the writ petition was to those letters/circulars.
4. The Kerala High Court, by the impugned order, has allowed the writ petition and quashed those letters/circulars directing following the presidential system of election in the students' union election and left it free to the colleges to follow the system of their choice. The directions in the concluding part of the impugned judgment is as follows:
In such circumstances the direction given in the letters to conduct election following the presidential system of election cannot be sustained and the affiliated colleges are free to follow a system which is better for the administration and discipline in the colleges. The writ petitions are allowed accordingly. The direction to conduct election following the presidential system of election will stand set aside.
5. The High Court held that the impugned circulars/letters had no statutory basis, and hence were invalid.
6. Against the aforesaid judgment, the University of Kerala has filed this appeal by grant of special leave.
7. It appears that when this matter came up before this Court, the Court was concerned about the manner in which students' union activities were carried on, including the manner of election to the students' union, throughout the country. The Court was concerned about the politicization/criminalization in such activities. Hence, this Court by order dated 12th December, 2005 directed appointment of a Committee and accordingly a Committee was constituted by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development, Union of India. The members of the Committee were:
1. Mr. J.M. Lyngdoh, Retd. Chief Election Commissioner(Chairman).
2. Dr. Zoya Hassan
3. Professor Pratap Bhanu Mehta
4. Dr. Daya Nand Dongaonkar (Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities).
8. Apart from the aforesaid members in the Committee, two other members were to be nominated by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development.
9. Consequent to the directions of this Court, the Committee headed by Mr. J.M. Lyngdoh, former Chief Election Commissioner, went into detail into all aspects of the matter and after having very wide consultations, including consultations with teachers, students' unions etc. submitted its Report dated 23rd May, 2006 to this Court.
10. This Court by a detailed order dated 22nd September, 2006 directed implementation of the Report of the Committee as an interim measure. By the said order, this Court directed that the recommendations of the Committee shall be followed in all colleges/universities elections hereinafter, until further orders.
11. I am not going into the details about various recommendations made by the Committee and we have no doubt that many of them are wholesome. Mr. Lyngdoh is a man of very high integrity and the whole nation is proud of him. I have no manner of doubt that the Committee headed by him considered the entire matter, referred to it, in great detail. However, I have grave reservations about the manner of implementation of the recommendations of the Committee by passing the order dated 22.9.2006.
12. The question of great constitutional importance which has arisen is "whether after getting the recommendations of some expert body by a court order, the Court itself can implement the said recommendations by passing a judicial order or whether the Court can only send it to the Legislature or its delegate to consider making a law for implementation of these recommendations".
13. The aforesaid question, therefore, raises a great constitutional question about judicial legislation, whether it is permissible at all under our Constitution, and even if it is, what is the extent of judicial legislation?
14. In my opinion, the interim order of this Court dated 22nd September, 2006, prima facie, amounts to judicial legislation and the question before us is whether this is legally permissible. I am prima facie of the opinion that it is not. As held by this Court in Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club and Anr. v. Chander Hass and Anr. MANU/SC/4463/2007 : (2008) 1 SCC 683(vide para 26):
...If there is a law, judges can certainly enforce it, but judges cannot create a law and seek to enforce it.
