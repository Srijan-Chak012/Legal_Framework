Case Note:
Constitution - Validity of Rule - Article 16 of Constitution of India - High Court allowed Petition filed by Respondent on ground that order of promotion made under Rule 13AA was violative of Articles 16(1) of Constitution - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, State Government could grant exemption to employees belonged only to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes from passing departmental test for promotion under Article 16 (1) of Constitution - Held, State could not indulge in excessive reservation so as to defeat policy contained in Article 16(1) and no reservation could be made at cost of efficiency which was prime consideration - Therefore, relaxation contained in Rule 13-AA of rules did not fall within Clause (4) of Article 16 but fell within Clause (1) of Article 16 - However, intention of Government was merely to help backward class of citizens to apply for job along with others by condoning delay for special reasons and they were senior in experience - Hence, Rule 13-AA of rules was a valid piece of statutory provision which was fully justified under Article 16(1)- Thus, High Court was in error in holding that Rule 13-AA was ultra vires - Appeal allowed.
Ratio Decidendi:
"Reservation is to be made within permissible limitation at the cost of efficiency which is the prime consideration."
JUDGMENT
1. This appeal is by certificate from the judgment dated 19 April, 1974 of the High Court of Kerala.
2. This appeal concerns the validity of Rule 13AA of the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958 hereinafter called the Rules and two orders which are marked P-2 and P-6.
3. In order to appreciate Rule 13AA, it is necessary to refer to Rules 12, 13A, 13AA. These rules were framed in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. These rules came into existence on 17 December, 1958.
4. "Promotion" is defined in Rule 2(11) to mean the appointment of a member of any category or grade of a service or a class of service to a higher category or grade of such service or class.
5. Rule 12 states that where general educational qualifications, special qualifications or special tests are prescribed by the Special Rules of a service for any category, grade or post therein, or in a class thereof, which are not prescribed for a category or grade in such service or class carrying a lower rate of pay and no member in the category or grade carrying the lower rate of pay is eligible for promotion to such category, grade or post a member in such lower category or grade may be promoted to the category or grade carrying the higher rate of pay temporarily until a member of the former category or grade qualified under this rule is available for promotion. A member temporarily promoted under this rule shall not by reason only of such promotion, be regarded as a probationer in the category or grade to which he has been promoted, or be entitled to any preferential claim to future promotion.
6. Rule 13 speaks of special qualifications. Rule 13 does not concern this appeal.
7. The two rules which are of importance in this appeal are Rules 13A and 13AA. They are as follows:-
13A. Special and Departmental Tests- Temporary exemption for promotion.- Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 13, where a pass in a special or departmental test is newly prescribed by the Special Rules of a service for any category, grade or post therein or in any class thereof, a member of a service who has not passed the said test but is otherwise qualified and suitable for appointment to such class, category, grade or post may within 2 years of the introduction of the test be appointed thereto temporarily. If a member so appointed does not pass the test within two years from the date of introduction of the said test or when the said test also involves practical training within two years after the first chance to undergo such training he shall be reverted to the class, category or grade or post from which he was appointed and shall not again be eligible for appointment under this rule:
Provided that a person so reverted shall not by reason only of the appointment under this rule be entitled to any preferential claim to future appointment to the class, category, grade or post, as the case may be to which he had been appointed under this rule:
Provided further that the period of temporary exemption shall be extended by two years in the case of a person belonging to any of the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes.
Provided also that this rule shall not be applicable to tests prescribed or purposes of promotion of the executive staff below the rank of Sub-Inspectors belonging to the Police Department.
13AA. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, the Government may, by order, exempt for a specified period, any member or members, belonging to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, and already in service, from passing the tests referred to in Rule 13 or Rule 13A of the said Rules.
Provided that this rule shall not be applicable to tests prescribed for purposes of promotion of the executive staff below the rank of Sub-Inspectors belonging to the Police Department.
8. It is necessary to state here that the third proviso to Rule 13A and the proviso to Rule 13AA were introduced with effect from 12 October, 1973. Rule 13AA was introduced with effect from 13 January, 1972. Exhibit P-2 an order dated 13 January, 1972. The order is made by the Governor. The order refers to a memorandum dated 19 June, 1971 from the President, Kerala Harijan Samskarika Kshema Samithy, State Committee, Trivandrum and a letter dated 13 November, 1971 from the Secretary, Kerala Public Service Commission, The order is as follows :-
The President, Kerala Harijan Samskarika Kshema Samithy, Trivandrum has brought to the notice of Government that a large number of Harijan employees are facing immediate reversion from their posts for want of test qualifications and has therefore requested that all Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes employees may be granted temporary exemption from passing the obligatory departmental tests for a period of two years with immediate effect.
(2) Government have examined the matter in consultation with the Kerala Public Service Commission and are pleased to grant temporary exemption to members already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified and special or departmental tests) for a period of two years.
(3) The benefit of the above exemption will be available to those employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are already enjoying the benefits of temporary exemption from passing newly prescribed tests under General Rule 13A. In their case, the temporary exemption will expire only on the date of expiry of the temporary exemption mentioned in para (2) above or on the date of expiry of the existing temporary exemption, whichever is later.
(4) This order will take effect from the date of the order.
9. Exhibit P-6 is an order dated 11 January 1974. It is an order made by the Governor. The order is as follows :-
Government are pleased to order that the period of temporary exemption granted to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the G.O. read above from passing all tests (unified and special or departmental tests) be extended from 13-1-1974 to cover a period during which two tests are held by the Public Service Commission and results thereof published so that each individual gets two chances to appear. Government also order that these categories of employees will not be given any further extension of time to acquire the test qualifications.
10. Purusuant to Rule 13AA which came into force on 13 January, 1972, the order Exhibit P-2 was passed on 13 January, 1972 granting temporary exemption to members already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified and special or departmental tests) for a period of two years. The exemption granted by Exhibit P-2 in almost all cases would have expired on 12 January, 1974.
11. The other impugned order i.e., Exhibit P-6 which was passed on 11 January, 1974 gave further exemption to members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes from 13 January, 1974 from passing tests to cover a period during which two tests would be held by the Public Service Commission and results thereof published so that each individual would get two chances to appear within that period. The Government also ordered that these categories of employees would not be given any further extension of time to acquire the test qualifications.
12. On the basis of these exemption orders, several promotions have been effected. The respondent alleged in the writ, petition that 12 Lower Division Clerks who were members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were promoted without test qualification The further allegation is that by an order dated 15 June, 1972, 19 Lower Division Clerks belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes were promoted as Upper Division Clerks of which 5 were unqualified Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members and 14 were qualified Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members. By order dated 19 September, 1972, another 8 promotions of members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes were ordered of which only two were qualified and the remaining six were unqualified. By another order dated 31 October, 1972, 7 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members were promoted without qualifying test and one was promoted with the qualifying test. The grievance of the respondent-petitioner before the High Court was that out of 51 vacancies which arose in the category of Upper Division Clerks in the year 1972, 34 were filled up by Scheduled Castes members who did not possess qualifications and only 17 were given to qualified persons.
13. The respondent is a Lower Division Clerk working in the Registration Department. For promotion to Upper Division Clerk in that Department on the basis of seniority, the Lower Division Clerks have to pass (1) Account Test (Lower), (2) Kerala Registration Test and (3) Test in the manual of office procedure. The respondent's grievance is that in view of certain concessions given to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, they were able to obtain promotions earlier than the respondent, though the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Thomas (Ray C. J.) (11] S.C 495 Tribes who were promoted had not passed the tests.
14. The respondent in the writ petition filed in the High Court asked for a declaration that Rule 13AA is unconstitutional and a mandamus for compelling the State to forbear from giving effect to order dated 13 January, 1972 marked Exhibit P-2. The respondent by an affidavit asked for a similar order that Exhibit P-6 dated 11 January 1974 be set aside.
15. The respondent's contentions in the High Court were that Rule 13AA of the Service Rules and Exhibits P-2, P-6 and Exhibit P-7 which was another order dated 31 October, 1972 and all orders of promotion made thereunder were violative of Articles 16(1) and 16(2). The High Court upheld the contentions of respondent No. 1.
16. The contention of the State is that the impugned rules and orders are not only legal and valid but also support a rational classification under Article 16(1).
17. The contentions on behalf of respondent No. 1 are these. First, Article 16 is a specific application of Article 14 in matters relating to employment or appointment to any service in the State. Clauses (1) and (2) of Article 16 give effect to equality before law guaranteed by Article 14 and to prohibition against discrimination guaranteed by Article 15(1). In other words, Article 16(1) is absolute in terms guaranteeing equality of opportunity to every individual citizen seeking employment or appointment Emphasis is placed on similar opportunity and equal treatment for seeking employment or appointment. Second, matters relating to employment in Article 16(1) include all matters in relation to employment both prior and subsequent to the employment and form part of the terms and conditions of service. Equal opportunity is to be given for appointment, promotion, termination of employment and payment of pension and gratuity. Third, the abridgement of equality guaranteed by Article 16(1) is only to the extent curtailed by Article 16(4). Apart from Article 16(4), the right guaranteed under Article 16(1) cannot be curtailed Article 16(4) is, in substance, an exception to rights guaranteed by Article 16(1) and (2). Fourth, Article 16(4) does not cover the entire field occupied by Article 16(1) and (2). Some of the matters relating to employment in respect of which equality of opportunity has been guaranteed by Article 16(1) and (2) do not fall within the mischief of non obstante clause in Article 16(4). To illustrate, Clauses (1) and (2) of Article 16 do not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for selection to any employment or appointment in office. Any provision as to the qualification for employment or appointment in office reasonably fixed and applicable to all citizens would be consistent with the doctrine of equality of opportunity in Article 16(1). Reasonable qualification of employment for the purpose of efficiency of service is justified. Fifth, Rule 13AA is violative of Article 16(1) and (2). The impeached Exhibits fall within the same mischief. There is no scope for dealing with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes different from other backward classes. Exemption from qualification necessary for promotion is not conducive to the maintenance of efficiency of administration and violates not only Article 335 of the Constitution but also Article 16(1).
18. Before the introduction of the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958 on 17 December, 1958 and also the formation of Kerala State on 1 Nov., 1956, the Travancore-Cochin Government had issued orders on 14 June, 1956 directing that the standard of qualification should be lower for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes than compared to others in the matter of examinations relating to various tests. By Government order dated 27 June, 1958, it was directed that the period of exemption for passing tests be extended by two years in the case of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Again by Government order dated 2 January, 1961, the period of exemption to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was further extended to 3 years. By another Government order dated 14 January, 1963, a unified account test (lower) and a test in office procedure were introduced replacing the old tests and as this was treated as a new test, all persons who were formerly in Travancore-Cochin or Madras Service were given two years time to pass the test and members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were given extra time in accordance with the orders earlier mentioned. A circular was issued on 9 February, 1968 granting 7 years' time from 14 January, 1963 to members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to pass the unified tests. This period was to expire on 14 January, 1970. On 13 January, 1970, an order was passed extending the time for another year upto 14 January, 1971. On 14 January, 1971 another Government order was issued extending the period by another year.
19. It was brought to the notice of the Government that large number of Government servants be-longing to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were unable to get their promotion because of want of test qualifications. In order to give relief to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the Government incorporated Rule 13AA which enabled the Government to grant exemption to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for a specified period. On 13 January, 1972 exemption from passing the tests was granted to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for two years. On 11 January, 1974 order was made under Rule 13AA giving members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes exemption from passing the tests for the period of two tests to be conducted after the order dated 11 January, 1974.
20. The criterion for promotion of Lower Division Clerks to Upper Division Clerks is seniority-cum-merit qualification. For want of test qualification a large number of Lower Division Clerks belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were passed over. It is because of the aforesaid Government order dated 1'3 January, 1972 marked Exhibit P-2 that promotions Were made according to seniority-cum-merit qualification. The larger share went to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes because they were senior hands. After the issue of the order dated 13 January, .1972, 34 out of 51 Lower Division Clerks who were promoted belonged to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These 34 persons were given temporary exemption from passing the departmental tests. It also appears that these 34 members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have become senior-most in the lower cadre.
21. Articles 14, 15 and 16 form part of a string of Constitutional guaranteed rights. These rights supplement each other. Article 16 which ensures to all citizens equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment is an incident of guarantee of equality contained in Article 14. Article 16(1) gives effect to Article 14. Both Articles 14 and 16(1) permit reasonable classification having a nexus to the objects to be achieved. Under Article 16 there can be a reasonable classification of the employees in matters relating to employment or appointment.
22. This Court in the State of Gujarat v. Shri Ambica Mills Ltd. Ahmedabad MANU/SC/0092/1974 : [1974]3SCR760 said:
The equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws. But laws may classify. And the very idea of classification is that of inequality. In tackling this paradox the Court has neither abandoned the demand for equality nor denied the legislative right to classify. It has taken a middle course. It has resolved the contradictory demands of legislative specialization and Constitutional generality by a doctrine of reasonable classification. (See Joseph Tussman and Jacobus ten Breck, "The Equal Protection of the Laws", 37 California Rev. 341.)
