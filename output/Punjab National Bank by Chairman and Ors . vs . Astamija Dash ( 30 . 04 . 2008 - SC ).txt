JUDGMENT
S.B. Sinha, J.
1. Leave granted in both the matters.
2. These two appeals arise out of a judgment and order dated 20th May, 2005 rendered by the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court at Cuttack in WP No. 2333 of 1991.
3. Writ Petitioner (Respondent in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 18997 of 2005 and Appellant in the connected appeal) was appointed as a Management Trainee in the Punjab National Bank (Bank). She was duly selected by the Banking Service Recruitment Board, Delhi. An offer of appointment was made to her favour on or about 28th July, 1986 inter alia on the following terms and conditions:
2. TRAINING/PROBATION/CONFIRMATION
You will be on training/probation for a period of 2 years from the date of your joining the Bank and you will be considered for confirmation in the service, subject to your satisfactory report on your training, passing Bank's confirmation test and receipt of satisfactory report from the Police authorities about your character and antecedents. You may also be required to pass a test in a language other than your mother tongue before confirmation.
3. During the period of probation your services can be terminated by giving one month's notice or payment of one month's emoluments in lieu thereof. The Bank may, however, in its discretion extend your probation by a further period not exceeding one year. If you desire to leave the services of the Bank at any time during the period of probation, including the extended period thereof, if any, you shall give a month's notice or in lieu thereof, you shall pay a month's emoluments to the bank.
4. She joined the services of the Bank immediately thereafter.
Pursuant to the condition that she must pass the confirmation test, she appeared in the said examination on 29th May, 1988. She did not pass the said examination. She was, however, again asked to appear in the examination on 1st October, 1989. By a letter dated 5th September, 1989 she expressed her inability to do so, stating:
I invite a kind reference to your letter dated 18th August, 1989 wherein I was advised to appear in the confirmation test scheduled to be held on 1 October, 1989 in Central Staff College, Delhi. In this context, I would like to inform you that I am passing through the period of pregnancy and am advised by the doctor not to undertake long journey during the period of pregnancy till delivery as a result of which I will not be able to appear the test.
I, therefore, request you to kindly consider my case sympathetically and permit me to appear the test on the next schedule date, in future. I enclose a medical certificate for your information and favourable consideration.
5. She had two mis-carriages. She was asked again to appear in the examination on 19th August, 1990. She appeared in the said test, but could not succeed. In the meanwhile the probation period expired on 28th July, 1988. It was extended by another year i.e. till 28th July, 1989.
6. Indisputably, she had otherwise completed her period of probation. She also fulfilled the other conditions of service. Her services, however, were terminated by an order dated 9th November, 1990 stating:
You were appointed as a Management Trainee on 25.8.1986. One of the terms of your appointment stipulates that:
3. CONFIRMATION
You will be considered for confirmation in the Bank service after two years on:
a) Satisfactory report of your training.
b) Passing Bank's confirmation Test.
c) You may also be required to pass a test in language other than your mother tongue before confirmation.
In the event of your not satisfactorily completing the training referred to in sub para 3(a) or failure to qualify the Bank's confirmation test within the training/probation period of two years or to pass the test in a language other than your mother tongue, your probation may be extended by a further period not exceeding one year.
If during the period of probation, including the period of extension, if any, the competent authority is of the opinion that you are not fit for confirmation to be retained in the bank service, your services shall be liable to be terminated by one month's notice or payment of one month's emoluments in lieu thereof.
You had appeared in the confirmation test held on 29.5.1988 but you did not qualify the same. In the confirmation test held on 1.10.1989, you have been advised to appear for the test but you had remained absent. Although the Bank would have been justified in terminating your services in accordance with your terms of appointment, a lenient view was taken and you were given a last and final opportunity for qualifying the confirmation test in August, 1990. You appeared in the Bank's confirmation test held on 19.8.1990 but did not qualify the test.
7. She preferred an appeal there against before the appellate authority asking for another chance to clear the confirmation test stating that similarly situated employees including one Indubala had been given another chance to appear at the examination. However, the said appeal was dismissed by an order dated 28th November, 1990.
8. She filed a writ petition before the High Court, inter alia, contending:
i) In terms of the Punjab National Bank (Officers) Service Regulations, 1979 insistence of passing the confirmation teat was illegal.
ii) As the extended period of probation expired on 28th July, 1989 she should be deemed to have been confirmed in service.
iii) She had been subjected to discriminatory treatment viz-a- vis. Indubala who was granted an opportunity to appear in the confirmation test for the 4th time on the ground of illness of her mother.
9. The High Court rejected the first two contentions raised by the writ petitioner herein but accepted the third. The writ petition was allowed on the said premise.
10. Both the parties, being aggrieved, are before us.
11. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank would submit:
i) Although Regulations do not provide for a confirmation test, the writ petitioner having accepted the conditions of appointment, she cannot be permitted to approbate or reprobate.
ii) Her services having not been expressly confirmed, the doctrine of implied confirmation is not applicable in view of the decision of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in General Manager, Punjab National Bank and Ors. v. Khar Bhan Ram MANU/UP/0133/1994 : (1995)IILLJ93All .
iii) Reliance placed by the High Court on the case of Indubala was misplaced as an affidavit explaining the situation had not been taken into consideration and in any event no legal right can be claimed on the basis of an illegality committed by the employer as Article 14 of the Constitution of India speaks of a positive right.
12. Mr. S.S. Upadhyay, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner, on the other hand, would submit:
i) The order of termination being not based on unsatisfactorily completion of the in-house training or the non-passing of a language test, which only have been provided for in the Regulations, the impugned order of termination could not have been passed on the premise that the writ petitioner did not pass the confirmation test.
ii) Having regard to Regulations 15 and 16 of the Regulations, her services having been terminated on 9th November, 1990 i.e., after the extended period of the period of probation upto 28th July, 1989 expired, she would be deemed to have been confirmed in service.
iii) In any event she had clearly been discriminated against inasmuch as an employee who was similarly situated had been given a fourth opportunity to clear the said confirmation test, whereas the writ petitioner was not.
13. The Bank is a scheduled Bank within the meaning of the provisions of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970. It has various statutory powers. It has inter alia power to frame Regulations. In exercise of its powers conferred upon it by Section 19 read with Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, the Board of Directors of the Punjab National Bank, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India and with the previous sanction of the Central Government made Regulations known as the Punjab National Bank (Officers') Service Regulations, 1979 (for short Regulations). Applicability of the said Regulations to the case of the writ petitioner is not in dispute.
14. Regulations 15, 16 and 36, which are relevant for our purposes may be noticed. In terms of Sub-regulation (1) of Regulation 15, the period of probation is two years. Sub-regulation (1) of Regulation 16 provides for confirmation of service, if in the opinion of the competent authority, the officer has satisfactorily completed the training in any institution to which he might have been deputed for training and in the in-service training in the bank. The proviso appended thereto provides for passing a test in a language other than the mother tongue of the office. Sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 16 provides for extension of the period of probation only in the event the officer does not satisfactorily complete either or both the trainings referred to in Sub-regulation (1) or fails to pass the test referred to therein. Extension of the period of probation, however, could not exceed a further period of one year. Sub-regulation (3) of Regulation 16 provides that service of an employee can be terminated in the case of a direct appointee, by one month's notice or payment of one month's emoluments in lieu thereof only when during the period of probation, including the period of extension, if any, the competent authority is of the opinion that the officer is not fit for promotion.
Regulation 36 provides for maternity regulation in terms whereof leave upto a period of six months can be granted.
15. Indisputably, the Regulations do not provide for passing of any confirmation test. Such a confirmation test had been prescribed only in the letter of appointment. Ordinarily, although when conflict occurs between an executive order and a statutory Regulation, the latter will prevail; we will proceed on the premise that such a condition could be imposed by the competent authority.
16. We, for the time being, would also assume that having regard to the doctrine of approbation and reprobation as also the doctrine of election, the writ petitioner could not question the validity or otherwise of the said executive action.
17. While saying so, however, we are not unmindful of the observations made by this Court in Municipal Corporation, Raipur v. Ashok Kumar Misra MANU/SC/0332/1991 : (1991)IILLJ343SC .
6. Exercise of the power to extend the probation is hedged with the existence of the rule in that regard followed by positive act of either confirmation of the probation or discharge from service or reversion to the substantive post within a reasonable time after the expiry of the period of probation. If the rules do not empower the appointing authority to extend the probation beyond the prescribed period, or where the rules are absent about confirmation or passing of the prescribed test for confirmation of probation then inaction for a very long time may lead to an indication of the satisfactory completion of probation.
