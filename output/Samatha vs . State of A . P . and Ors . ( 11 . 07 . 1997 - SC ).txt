JUDGMENT

1. Leave granted.
2. These appeals are directed to resolve mutually inconsistent law adumbrated by two Di vision Benches of Andhra Pradesh High Court. The appeals arising from S.L.P. (C) No. 17080-81/95 are filed against the judgment passed on April 28, 1995 in Writ Petition Nos. 9513/93 and 7725/94 (reported in 1996 AIHC 316 in which the Division Bench has held that the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation (1 of 1959), as amended by Regulation 2 of 1970(for short, the 'Regulation') and the Mining Act (67 of 1957) do not prohibit grant of mining leases of Government land in the scheduled area to the non-tribals. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (for short, the 'FC Act') does not apply to the renewals. The Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 also does not apply to the renewal of the leases. It, accordingly, dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellant challenging the power of the Government to transfer the Government land situated in the tribal area to the non-tribals for mining purpose.
3. In the appeal arising from S.L.P. (C) No. 21457 of 1993 filed by Hyderabad Abrasives and Minerals, another Division Bench, earlier had taken dramatically the opposite view and held that mining leases are illegal. The word' 'person' used in Section 3 of the Regulation includes Government. Any lease to the non-tribals even of a Government land situated in scheduled area is in violation of Section 3 and so is void. Equally, it held that a mining lease in a forest area for non-forest purpose or renewal thereof, without prior approval of the Central Government, is in violation of Section 2 of the FC Act. Accordingly, the Division Bench directed the Government to prohibit mining operations in scheduled area except that the mines stacked on the surface be permitted to be removed after obtaining proper permits. This decision, though earlier in point of time, was not brought to the notice of later Bench mentioned above.
4. The admitted facts are that Borra reserved forest area along with its environs consisting of 14 villages, is the Notified scheduled area in Ananthagiri Mandal of Visakhapatnam District of Andhra Pradesh. The State Government granted mining leases in this area to several non-tribal persons. K. Appa Rao, respondent No. 13, was granted mining lease in that reserved forest area. Most of the area granted to M/s. Perolase India Ltd., respondent No. 7 falls in reserved forest area. M/s. Unirock Minerals Pvt. Ltd., respondent No. 8 had 125.30 acres in the reserved forest area and 45.70 acres in the non-reserved forest area. M/s. Kalyani Minerals, respondent No. 10 had 48.00 acres in the reserved forest area and 32 acres in non-reserved forest area. One M. Seethrama Swamy was granted mining lease of an extent of 300 acres in Borra reserved forest area. Sri R. K. Deo is also having mining lease in that area. Respondent No. 9 is said to be the legal heir of M. Seethrama Swamy. These facts are admitted in the counter-affidavit filed by the Government.
5. It is also an admitted fact that Ananthagiri Mandal in which the mining areas are situated, is within the scheduled area. The tribal people from tribal groups are inhabiting therein. Two mining leases were granted to the Chalpati Rat), respondent No. 11 for graphite to an extent of 50 acres in Nandkote Reserve Forest for a period of 20 years on August 26, 1971. The lease deed was executed on January 24, 1972 and expired on January 23, 1992; it is stated that thereafter mining operations are not being carried on. Similarly, mining lease for an extent of 111 acres of land situated in Chimidipalli and Saripalli villages of Ananthagiri Mandal, was granted on August 29, 1974. The lease was executed on December 20, 1974 for a period of 20 years which expired on December 19, 1994. Mining lease for Andhra Phosphates (P) Ltd. was granted to an extent of 271.544 hectares in Y. Seetharampuram, Veduruvada Reserved Forest on March 23, 1957 for 20 years. The lease deed was executed on June 10, 1957 which was renewed for 20 years on May 2, 1978. The renewed deed was executed on the even date which would continue up to June 9, 1997. As stated earlier, K. Apparao, respondent No. 13, was granted mining lease for 20 years on July 26, 1978 which was executed on January 24. 1979. It is due to expire on July 23, 1999. But, it is stated that at present he is not working out the mining operations. Respondent No. 14, M. Venkalapathi Raju was granted mining lease for 13.84 acres for yellow Ochra in unsurveyed revenue poramboke, in Konapuram, Ananthagiri Mandal for a period of 20 years on April 4, 1980. The lease deed was executed on April, 26, 1981 and is to expire on April 25, 2001. It is claimed that the lease is not being worked out and it is said to have lapsed. The lease granted to M/s. Visaka Mines and Minerals, respondent No. 15, is said to be in non-surveyed area in Mandaparti village of Ananthagiri Mandal on July 20, 1978 for a period of 20 years. The lease deed was executed on December 18, 1978 and it would expire on December 17, 1998. They are working out their mines. Another lease was granted for 130 acres in reserved forest area of Sivalingam village of Ananthagiri Mandal on September 20, 1977 for a period of 20 years which expires on December 30, 1997. It is stated that the lease had lapsed since it was not being worked out, w.e.f. February 9, 1988 as per G.O.Ms. No. 295 dated June 6, 1989. Associated Mica Exports, respondent No. 16 holds two leases for 50 acres in Dumbriguda village of Ananthagiri Mandal for a period of 20 years granted on March 13, 1986. The lease was executed on September 11, 1986 and it is to expire on September 10, 2006. It is stated that lease is not being worked out at present. They had another lease for 10 acres in Borra group of villages for 20 years granted on October 20, 1983 and the lease deed was executed on November 21, 1983. The lease is to expire on November 20, 2003. It is stated that the mining is not being worked out at present. Respondent No. 17, N. Madan Mohan Reddy had a lease in Mallagumuru village of Ananthagiri Mandal. The extent of the land has not been mentioned but the lease was granted on July 4, 1984. The lease was executed on September 5, 1984 and it is to expire on September 4, 2004. It is stated that the mine is not being worked out at present. M/s. Trowall Cements Ltd. obviously got it transferred from N. Madan Mohan reddy to whom lease was granted for 20 years in G.O.Ms. No. 303, Industries and Commerce on July 9, 1984 for a period of 20 years. The lease deed was executed by Madan Mohan Reddy on January 7, 1985 and is due to expire on January 6, 2005. It is stated that the mining is not being worked out and steps are being taken to declare it as a lapsed lease. It is the case of the appellant that the above lease was sub-leased to M/s. Indian Rayon Industries Ltd., respondent No. 19 but in the affidavit filed by the Government, it is said that no steps are taken to win over the mine from the leased area. On the other hand, in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No. 19, it is admitted that the mines are being worked out and that high purity calcite with minimum silica content is their product. Calcite mine is available in Visakhapatnam District at a short distance of 100 kms. from their factory situated in Visakhapatnam. One M. Laxminarayana was the lessee of an extent of 21.56 acres of land in Nimmalapadu village in Ananthagiri Mandal which is valid up to May 31, 2005. Another lease of 37.895 hectares in Ananthagiri Mandal was granted for a period of 10 years. The lease is valid up to July 3, 1996. Respondent No. 19 had transfer of the said lease in its favour in G.O.Ms. No. 4, Industry and Commerce dated January 5, 1993 and they are working out the mines. M/s. Birla Periclase is a subsidiary of respondent No. 19. It is stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Government that 21.56 acres of land containing mica, calcite, quartz and yellow ochra in Nimmalapudu village which is the subject-matter of the original lease dated November 17, 1984 for a period of 20 years had by M. Laxminarayana, was transferred to respondent No. 19. It was stated that the same has further been transferred in favour of M/s. A.P. Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. on December 20, 1994 by G.O.Ms. No. 456 dated December 7, 1994. The latter is a State Government Undertaking but that is not so stated in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No. 19. It is sought to be justified that M. Laxminarayana, respondent No. 20, has a legal right to assign the lease in favour of respondent No. 19. It is also admitted in the Government's counter-affidavit that by operation of Section 11(5) of the Mine and Mineral (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 (for short, the 'Mining Act'), as amended by State Act, on and from August 14, 1991, no mining leases in the scheduled area should be granted in favour of non-tribals. It is also admitted that tribals have their patta lands in five enclosures and have their right to cultivate those lands. It is the case of the appellant that after re-survey, the entire area was identified as reserved forest area or at any rate is a forest area in scheduled area.
6. On this factual matrix, the appellant-Society claiming to protect the interests and life of the Scheduled Tribes in the area, filed the writ petitions questioning the power of the Government to grant mining leases in favour of non tribals in the scheduled area, in violation of the Regulation which prohibits transfer of any land in scheduled area to a non-tribal. The Division bench of the High Court has held that the Regulation does not prohibit transfer of the Government land by way of lease to the non-tribals. The word 'person' in Section 3 of the Regulation is applicable to natural persons, namely, tribals and non-tribals. The Regulation prohibits transfer of the land in scheduled area by a tribal to a non-tribal natural persons. The leases granted in accordance with the provisions of the Mining Act to non-tribals are valid. The FC Act was not violated by grant of leases or renewal thereof. Therefore, the writ, as sought for, was not available. Resultantly, the writ petitions were dismissed.
7. In the appeal of M/s. Hyderabad Abrasives and Minerals, the admitted facts are that the appellant was granted mining lease for 20 years in 1974 for mining literate situated in Peddamaredumilli Reserved Forest Area in East Godavari District. The total extent of the land leased was 318 acres out of which it was carrying on mining operation in 42 acres. Similarly, other persons were also granted mining leases in the reserved forest area in East Godavari District. Consequently, M/s. Shakti, the voluntary organisation filed the writ petition in the High Court questioning the power of the Government to grant mining leases in violation of Section 3 of the Regulation and the FC Act. The lease expired in 1994. The Division Bench held that by operation of the prohibition contained in Section 3 of the Regulation and Section 2 of the FC Act, the appellant is not entitled to mining operations. However, since he had already broken up the mining, the excavated mine on the surface may be removed on obtaining permission from the appropriate authorities. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the above appeal.
8. The primary questions in these cases are: whether the Regulation would apply to transfer of Government land to a non-tribal?; whether the Government can grant mining lease of the lands situated in scheduled area to a non-tribal?; whether the leases are in violation of Section 2 of the FC Act?; and whether the leases are in violation of Environment Protection Act, 1986 (for short, the 'EP Act')? It is stated in paragraph 3(c) of the petition of Samatha that the Borra Reserve Forest area was part of the domain of the Rajah of Jeypore and from time immemorial, it was a tribal area occupied by tribal villages. They have pattas in their favour and do cultivation. In 1967, 14 villages were declared as Borra Reserved Forest. About 250 tribal families settled in 14 villages have in their occupation, 436 acres of land in five enclosures. They are situated in Ananthagiri Mandal. In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No. 10, M/s. Kalyani Minerals, it is admitted that Borra caves may be as old as million of years. It is admitted that the "entire area around Borra caves is thickly forested." In the counter-affidavit filed by the District Forest Officer, respondent No. 4, it is admitted that Ananthagiri Mandal is a scheduled area the tribals belong to diverse denominations. It is also one of the important hill regions of the eastern ghats and is known not only for the diversity of its flora and fauna but also for the richness of mineral deposits. It is also rich in forest wealth and the minerals. It is their contention that the forest wealth in this area is the national assets.
Agriculture -- a means of livelihood, succor for social justice and base for dignity of person.
9. Agriculture is the main part of the economy and source of livelihood to the rural Indians and a source and succor for social status and a base for dignity of person. Land is a tangible product and sustaining asset to the agriculturists. In Waman Rao v. Union of India MANU/SC/0091/1980 : [1981] 2 SCR 1 a Constitution Bench had observed that India being a predominantly agricultural society, there is a "strong linkage between the land and the person's status in social system." The strip of land on which they till and live assures them equal justice and "dignity of their person by providing to them a near decent means of livelihood." Agricultural land is the foundation for a sense of security and freedom from fear. Assured possession is a lasting source for peace and prosperity.
10. Agriculture is the only source of livelihood for Scheduled Tribes, apart from collection and sale of minor forest produce to supplement their income. Land is their most important natural and valuable asset and imperishable endowment from which the tribals derive their sustenance, social status, economic and social equality, permanent place of the abode and work and living. It is a security and source for economic empowerment. Therefore, the tribes too have great emotional attachment to their lands. The land on which they live and till, assures them equality of status and dignity of person and means to economic and social justice and potent weapon of economic empowerment in social democracy.
