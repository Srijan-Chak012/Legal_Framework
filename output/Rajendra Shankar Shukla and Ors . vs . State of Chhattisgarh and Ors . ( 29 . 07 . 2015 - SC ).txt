Facts

The Appellants were landowners of portions of land in villages in Chhattisgarh. The 'Kamal Vihar Township Development Scheme No. 4' (KVTDS) was planned by Respondent No. 2 while discharging its functions under Section 38(2) of the Act, 1973. Though the KVTDS initially started as a small Town Development Scheme, it subsequently included the aforesaid five villages in Raipur within its Scheme. The KVTDS was initially planned and proposed for an area of 416.93 acres, and the CEO of Respondent No. 2 issued a public notification declaring its intention of coming up with an integrated township of that area. However, a month after the publication of the notification, the Board of Respondent No. 2 increased the area of the integrated KVTDS from 416.93 acres to 2300 acres, which resulted in the inclusion of the lands of the Appellants.

At the time of appeal, the KVTDS had a total project area of 647.84 hectares, out of which the area available for development was 610.46 hectares, with 482.29 hectares of that being private land and 128.17 hectares government land. According to the development plan, the area of 647.84 hectares was also marked for recreational land, roads and lanes and other miscellaneous infrastructure like educational, hygienic and various public purpose amenities. The broad features of KVTDS showed 15 sectors and estimated the cost of development of infrastructure at Rs. 1085 crores. The Government agreed to hand over its land to Respondent No. 2 and land belonging to private owners was to be taken by the consent or by acquisition under Section 56 of the Act, 1973.

Respondent No. 2 planned to develop land and hand over about 35% of the developed plot to land owners without charging any contribution/incremental cost from them in return for their acquired land for the development of the KVTDS, under Section 56 of the Act, 1973. The remaining area of their undeveloped plot would be retained and may have gone to other land owners or may be utilised for constructing other facilities under KVTDS. According to Respondent No. 2, 15% of the developed plots had been reserved for economically weaker sections, which come to about 32.15 hectares.

The Appellants did not agree to KVTDS and the procedure adopted, and filed petitions before the Single Judge of the High Court, which were dismissed. The Division Bench of the High Court, dismissing the appeals of the Appellants too upheld the validity of the KVTDS. Hence, the present appeals.

Held, allowing the appeals

1.The Constitution Under Article 243ZD directs setting up of a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by Panchayats and Municipalities in the Districts and to prepare a draft development plan for district as a whole and the Director of every DPC shall forward such development plans as recommended by the Committee to the government of the State. After the insertion of part IX-A in the Constitution, development plan for a District can only be drawn by the democratically elected representative body i.e. DPC, by taking into account the factors mentioned in Clause (3)(a)(i), (ii) of Article 243ZD; as per Clause (4) of Article 243ZD, the DPC shall forward the development plan as recommended by the committee to the Government of the State. The Respondent No. 2, has framed the Town Development Scheme without consulting or taking into account the views of the Panchayat and the District Planning Committee which are constitutionally authorized to undertake the task of framing Scheme.[9],[13] and[14]

2.From the minutes of the Board meeting which took the decision to add 1900 acres to KVTDS was not based on a prior survey or assessment of the need for addition of land to the area of KVTDS. Section 14 of the Act, 1973 confers power upon the Director of Town and Country Planning to prepare development plans. Read with Section 17 of the Act, 1973, it mandates the Director of Respondent No. 2 to take into consideration, any draft Five Year Plan and Annual Development Plan of a district prepared under the Madhya Pradesh Zila Yojana Samiti Adhiniyam, 1995. It is not proven that the Director had taken into account any report made under the 1995 Adhiniyam. On the other hand, it is shown that the Development Plan has been altered to suit the requisites of KVTDS. This action by the Director is impermissible and unlawful.[24] and[26]

3.As per the evidence produced before us, on 20.07.2009, S.S. Bajaj, served as the CEO of Respondent No. 2 during the proposed addition of 1900 acres of land in KVTDS. About 20 days later, the same S.S. Bajaj was serving as Special Secretary, to Respondent No. 1, and approved the addition of 1900 acres of land to the scheme which is a clear case of bias. The decision taken by S.S. Bajaj as Special Secretary, to Respondent No. 1 in approving the proposal of Respondent No. 2 to include large extent of land to the KVTDS is vitiated action in law as tainted with bias and non-application of mind on the part of Respondent No. 1. It could not have sanctioned the KVTDS as it is in contravention to the procedure laid down in Section 50 of the Act, 1973.[27],[29] and[31]

4.The phrase "at any time" under Section 50(1) of the Act, 1973 does not permit arbitrary decisions as and when a scheme has to be framed. The words "at any time" have no exemption from all forms of limitation for unexplained and undue delay, as such an interpretation would result in destruction of citizens' rights, but also go contrary to the context in which the power has been conferred upon the authority. There is no survey report to show how the KVTDS was introduced for a population of 16,000 per 40 hectares by Respondent No. 2. Frequent changes in the extent of land acquired for the KVTDS suggests strongly that there is no rationale behind the proposal of the KVTDS.[33],[35] and[36]

5.Under Sections 20 and 21 of the Act, 1973 a Zonal Plan can be prepared only in adherence to the Development Plan which was the Raipur Master Plan of 2021. Section 49 of the Act, 1973 read along with Section 21 of the Act, 1973 mentions that the land required for acquisition by the Town and Country Development Authority for the purpose of any development scheme has to be laid down in the Zonal Plan. Therefore, the Master Plan 2021 is the umbrella under which a zonal plan is made for the city. The Respondents sought changes in it to suit KVTDS. Unless the master plan allows use of a particular area as 'residential', it is not open for Respondent No. 2 to propose a township or a town development scheme whose land use is at variance with the one provided in the development plan. KVTDS was not prepared in accordance with Section 50 of the Act, 1973 and it is ultra vires to the Act, 1973.[37],[38] and[39]

6.The Board of Respondent No. 2 conferred power upon the Respondent No. 2 to make provision for reconstitution and not for reconstruction per se. In any event, such power to make provision for reconstitution is limited to certain specified public purposes, which does not include general housing scheme. There is no declaration of intent preceding publication in the gazette, Board Resolutions which are not declared to the public in the matter prescribed under the Act of 1973, and same do not amount to declaration. The Act, 1956 does not empower the Respondent No. 2 to reconstitute plots.[52],[53] and[54]

7.The committee constituted under Section 50(5) was headed by CEO of Respondent No. 2, who himself proposed inclusion of 1900 acres of land. This affected the rights of the Appellants as they did not receive a fair hearing before the committee. There was no freezing of land use while the committee was hearing the objections and Respondent No. 2 kept on proposing change in land use. This affected the statutory rights of the land owners who were entitled to fair hearing against the acquisition of land. The reconstitution of plots for the purpose of town development scheme is permissible for public purpose only and by following the legal procedure of publication by the authority in the Gazette about its intent to acquire land. In the absence of the same, and also when the purpose for reconstitution of land is not for public purpose, such reconstitution of land is impermissible under the Act.[66] and[67]

8.Since compensation for acquisition of land needs to be reasonable and adequate, returning 35% of land in lieu of acquisition is constitutionally impermissible. This is also because the 'development' which occurs due to the implementation of the Town Development Scheme accrues the benefit to everyone. The Appellants whose land has been acquired and proposed to be developed, would have gained from the development as a member of the community gaining from the town development scheme and not in their individual capacity. When the compensation for land acquisition is determined, the price of the land on the date of the declaration of intention of acquisition is taken into consideration and not subsequent development after acquisition since the development is not connected to acquisition. Similarly, if the land is reconstituted in plots for distribution to the Economically Weaker Sections of the community or other public purposes, the same cannot be done by arbitrarily depriving land owners of their constitutional rights.[68]

9.The figure of 35% of land returned to the Appellants was arrived at by Respondent No. 2 while allocating reconstituted land without any valid form of calculation by the Respondents. It is an arbitrary action of the Respondents because the percentage of reconstituted land to be returned to the land owners varies from 35% to 58% for large plot holders and small plot holders. Respondent No. 2 had already taken a decision that not more than 40% of land will be returned to the land owners. This decision is arrived at without taking into consideration the value of each portion of land on the basis of their geographical locations.[69]

10.Respondent No. 2 has deviated from the mandatory conditions as prescribed under the Environment Clearance, which stated that 'the project proponent shall not deviate from the land use proposals in the scheme area as provided under the said master plan'. Respondent No. 1 issued circular with regard to change in land use from agricultural to residential purposes. The land use in the concerned khasras was already notified as 'residential' under the Master Plan. Notification was published in the official Gazette of the State government with regard to change of the land use of khasras from Agricultural to Residential purposes in the villages. As per condition (ii) of the EC, 185 hectares of land has to be maintained. The land use approved by Respondent No. 2 only provides for 129.42 hectares of land for green zone. Condition (v) of the General Conditions, stipulated that if the scope of a project is changed, fresh permission should be sought from the SEIAA. This resulted in change in scope of the project. This resulted in change in scope of the project. Under specific condition of the Environmental Clearance, fresh EC should have been sought and obtained by Respondent No. 2. The appeals are allowed.[78],[79],[80] and[81]

JUDGMENT
V. Gopala Gowda, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The Appellants-land owners have filed the present group of appeals challenging the common impugned judgment and order dated 16.6.2014 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur, in Writ Appeal Nos. 379, 380, 381, 382, 389 and 393 of 2013 wherein the High Court upheld the order dated 15.4.2013 passed by the learned single Judge of the High Court of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur, upholding the validity of the Town Development Scheme, namely, 'Kamal Vihar Township Development Scheme No. 4' (for short 'the KVTDS').
3. The facts of the case are stated hereunder:
The Appellants herein are the landowners of portions of land (with some construction thereon) situated in the villages Dumartarai, Tikrapara, Boriya Khurd, Deopuri and Dunda of Raipur District in Chhattisgarh State. The Respondent No. 2-Raipur Development Authority (RDA) was established Under Section 38(1) of the M.P. (C.G.) Nagar Thatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam, 1973 (for short 'the Act of 1973'). The KVTDS was planned by the Respondent No. 2-RDA while discharging its functions Under Section 38(2) of the Act of 1973. Though the KVTDS initially started as a small Town Development Scheme, it subsequently included the aforesaid five villages in Raipur within its Scheme.
4. As per the evidence on record produced before us, which are the written communications between the State Government, Respondent No. 2-RDA and the Director of Town and Country Planning, the KVTDS was initially planned and proposed for an area of 416.93 acres only. The Chief Executive Officer of the Respondent No. 2-RDA had issued public notification declaring its intention of coming up with an integrated township of 416.93 acres only. However, a month after the publication of said notification, the Board of Respondent No. 2-RDA, increased the area of the integrated Township Scheme from 416.93 acres to 2300 acres which resulted in the inclusion of the lands of the Appellants herein.
At present, the said Scheme has a total project area of 647.84 Hect., out of which the area available for development is 610.46 Hect. While 482.29 Hect. of the total land is private land, 128.17 Hect. is government land.
5. According to the development plan, in the above area of 647.84 Hect., further areas have been marked for recreational land, roads and lanes and other miscellaneous infrastructure like educational, hygienic and various public purpose amenities. The broad features of the Scheme would show that there shall be 15 Sectors and the estimated cost of development of infrastructure would be Rs. 1085 crores. The Government agreed to hand over its land to the Respondent No. 2-RDA and the land belonging to the private owners were to be taken over by the consent or by acquisition Under Section 56 of the Act of 1973.
6. The RDA planned to develop the land and hand over about 35% of the developed plot to the land owners without charging any contribution/incremental cost from them in return for their acquired land for the development of the KVTDS Under Section 56 of the Act of 1973. The remaining area of their undeveloped plot would be retained and subsequently, may go to the other land owners or may be utilized for constructing other facilities under the development Scheme. According to Respondent No. 2-RDA, 15% of the developed plots have also been reserved for economically weaker sections which come to about 32.15 Hect.
7. Out of the total 4969 private land owners, 39 land owners did not agree to the Scheme/procedure adopted and preferred 23 writ petitions on various grounds which were dismissed by the learned single Judge of the High Court of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur. Aggrieved by the same, six Writ Appeals were filed by 13 land owners. The Division Bench of the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur, after considering the facts, circumstances and evidence on record of the cases, upheld the validity of the KVTDS planned by the RDA and dismissed the appeals on the ground that the same were devoid of merit. Hence, the present appeals.
8. We have heard the learned senior Counsel for both the parties. On the basis of the factual circumstance and evidence on record produced before us and also in the light of the rival legal contentions raised by the learned senior Counsel for both the parties, we have broadly framed the following points which require our attention. The main legal issues which arise in this case are:
(1) Whether the KVTDS provide the authority to the Director of the Respondent No. 2-RDA, to formulate Town Development Scheme and is it in contravention to the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution of India?
(2) Whether the Town Development Scheme in the present case is formulated as per the provision mentioned in Section 50(1) of the Act of 1973? Whether the subsequent alteration of land acquired, is in consonance with the provisions of the Act?
(3) Whether the Town Development Scheme framed in the present case by the Respondent No. 2-RDA, in the absence of a zonal plan, is legal and valid?
(4) Whether the Act of 1973 authorises the Town Planning and Development Authority to reconstitute the plots and change the land use apart from public utility?
(5) Whether the proposal of the RDA to return 35% of the area of the land taken away from the land owners/Appellants is legally permissible?
(6) While planning the KVTDS, whether the Respondents ensured compliance with EIA clearance procedure from the competent authority?
Answer to Point No. 1
9. As per Part IX and Part IX-A of the Constitution, a zonal plan has to be framed by democratic institutions as prescribed under its provisions. On the other hand, the Respondent No. 2-RDA, has framed the Town Development Scheme without consulting or taking into account the views of the Panchayat and the District Planning Committee which are constitutionally authorized to undertake the task of framing Scheme. It was argued by Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, learned senior Counsel on behalf of the Appellants that the Respondent No. 2-RDA had assumed the role of town planning authority by proposing and framing KVTDS with land use which is different from the one prescribed in the Raipur Master Plan (Revised) 2021. In fact, the proposal made by Respondent No. 2-RDA defined spaces that are meant for business Districts, public use, schools, house and parks etc. This task taken up by the Respondent No. 2-RDA of allocation of spaces is by statute vested with the 'local authority' under its power to make zonal plans. It was further contended by the learned senior Counsel that the Raipur Master Plan (Revised) 2021, on the basis of which the KVTDS claims to be implementing the Scheme has also amended the same without the participation of the District Planning Committee which is the constitutionally empowered body to carry out social and economic planning for a District.
10. The 73rd and 74th Amendments were inserted in the Constitution of India with the avowed object and intention of strengthening the local self-governance both at the village and District level. It was argued by the learned senior Counsel Mr. Gopal Subramaniam that self-governance was very much a part of the Indian society historically. In support of his contention, he relied upon the words of Sir Charles Metcalfe, the Acting Governor General of India from 1835 to 1836, on the functioning of the village panchayats made during the 19th century which are recorded as under:
The village communities are little republics, having nearly everything they can want within themselves, and most independent of any foreign relations. They seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds after revolution; but the village community remains the same. The union of the village communities, each one forming a separate little state, in itself, has I conceive, contributed more than any other cause to the preservation of the people of India, through all the revolutions and changes which they have suffered, and is in a high degree conducive to their enjoyment of a great portion of freedom and independence1
It is imperative to note here that the Constitution, initially did not vest with power on villages or communities as units. It rather vested power on individual as units of the society. It was proposed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution, that the administration of India should not be carried out at village level since they are ignorant units of communities immune from the progress of the city and are also influenced by social biases and prejudices. With this biases and prejudices, it was apprehended that India, at the time during the drafting of the Constitution, were not suited to be ruled at village and panchayat level. On the other hand, Dr. Ambedkar proposed that there should be a strong Centre governed by the Rule of Law for the administration of the country. Formal inclusion of the panchayats in the constitutional system was deferred for a later time since the framers of the Constitution deemed it fit to introduce social reforms in the village prior to conferring upon them the power of self-governance, in the light of the constraints faced by the new republic of India. Article 40, therefore, was inserted in the Constitution in the form of Directive Principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Constitution so as to move towards the vision of introducing local governance when the time seems fit. Though, this was the decision taken at the time of the drafting of the Constitution, most of the framers in the Constituent Assembly reposed their faith on the potential of village panchayats and were of the opinion that self-governance at local level is the only way forward to realize Swaraj for our country. Shri Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, the member of the Constituent Assembly, presented his opinion on village panchayats before the Assembly which is recorded as under:
But who are these republics? They have to be brought into existence.....Therefore, I would advise that in the directives, a clause must be added, which would insist upon the various governments that may come into existence in future to establish village panchayats, give them political autonomy also economic independence in their own way to manage their own affairs.2
11. It is further to be noted that Entry 5 in the list-II to the VIIth Schedule of the Constitution enables the State Legislature to make laws pertaining to local government which also include the powers to be vested on the Municipal corporations, Improvement Trusts, Authorities, Mining Settlement Authorities, District Boards and other local authorities for the purpose of village administration and the local self-governance. The constitutional amendment in 1992-93 through the 73rd and 74th Amendment Act provided for uniformity in the structure in terms of three-tier local governments at the District (Zila Parishads-ZPs), Block (Panchayat Samitis-PS) and Village levels (Gram Panchayats-GPs). With the constitutional amendment, the panchayats are constitutionally expected to move away from their traditional role of simply executing the programs handed down to them by higher levels of government. They are on the other hand, expected to implement their own programs of economic development and social justice. The amendments further confer power upon the States in the form of Schedule XI to enlarge the domain of panchayats and to include functions with distributional consequences. This schedule includes key functions such as agriculture, drinking water, education, irrigation, poverty alleviation, primary, secondary and adult education, roads and rural electrification and maintenance of community assets.
12. It is further submitted by the learned senior Counsel, Mr. Gopal Subramaniam that as per Article 243G(1), the authority to prepare plans for economic development and social justice has been vested with the Gram Panchayat. Articles 243W and 243ZF have also been inserted to vest the local authority with the power to prepare plans for economic development. The 12th Schedule inserted into the Constitution specifically lists "urban planning including town planning" as an entry on which local authorities have full power Under Article 243W of the Constitution.
Further, Article 243ZD was inserted into the Constitution wherein the power to prepare a draft development plan is vested with the District Planning Committee (DPC). The above mentioned provision of the Constitution is extracted hereunder:
243ZD. (1) There shall be constituted in every State at the district level a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by the Panchayats and the Municipalities in the district and to prepare a draft development plan for the district as a whole.
(2) The Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to-
(a) the composition of the District Planning Committees;
(b) the manner in which the seats in such Committees shall be filled: Provided that not less than four-fifths of the total number of members of such Committee shall be elected by, and from amongst, the elected members of the Panchayat at the district level and of the Municipalities in the district in proportion to the ratio between the population of the rural areas and of the urban areas in the district;
(c) the functions relating to district planning which may be assigned to such Committees;
(d) the manner in which the Chairpersons of such Committees shall be chosen.
(3) Every District Planning Committee shall, in preparing the draft development plan,-
(a) have regard to- (i) matters of common interest between the Panchayats and the Municipalities including spatial planning, sharing of water and other physical and natural resources, the integrated development of infrastructure and environmental conservation;
(ii) the extent and type of available resources whether financial or otherwise;
(b) consult such institutions and organisations as the Governor may, by order, specify.
(4) The Chairperson of every District Planning Committee shall forward the development plan, as recommended by such Committee, to the Government of the State.
Also, Under Article 243ZF, any law inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution will be held void. Article 243ZF reads as under:
243ZF. Continuance of existing laws and municipalities.- Notwithstanding anything in this Part, any provision of any law relating to Municipalities in force in a State immediately before the commencement of the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, which is inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall continue to be in force until amended or repealed by a competent Legislature or other competent authority or until the expiration of one year from such commencement, whichever is earlier:
Provided that all the Municipalities existing immediately before the commencement shall continue till the expiration of their duration, unless sooner dissolved by a resolution passed to that effect by the Legislative Assembly of that State or, in the case of a State having a Legislative Council, by each House of the Legislative of that State.
Similar provision exists for the Gram Panchayats Under Article 243N of the Constitution.
13. In the present case, the District Planning Committee (DPC) has been constituted Under Section 3 of the Chhattisgarh Zila Yojna Samiti Act, 1995 (for short 'the Act of 1995') with an intention to democratize the town planning process to give effect to the legislative intendment. Section 7 of the Act of 1995 provides for functions of the DPC as has been prescribed by the Constitution. The Constitution Under Article 243ZD directs setting up of a DPC to consolidate the plans prepared by Panchayats and Municipalities in the Districts and to prepare a draft development plan for district as a whole and the Director of every DPC shall forward such development plans as recommended by the Committee to the government of the State.
14. After the insertion of part IX-A in the Constitution, development plan for a District can only be drawn by the democratically elected representative body i.e. DPC, by taking into account the factors mentioned in Clause (3)(a)(i), (ii) of Article 243ZD. As per Clause (4) of Article 243ZD, the Chairman of other DPC shall forward the development plan as recommended by the committee to the Government of the State.
