JUDGMENT
H.L. Gokhale, J.
1. What is the nature and significance of the planning process for a large Municipal town area? In that process, what is the role of the Municipal Corporation, which is the statutory planning authority? Can the State Government interfere in its decisions in that behalf and if so, to what extent? Does the State Government have the power to issue instructions to the Municipal Corporation to act in a particular manner contrary to the Development Plan sanctioned by the State Government, and that too a number of years after the Municipal Corporation having taken the necessary steps in consonance with the plan? Can the State Government instruct a Municipal Corporation to shift the reservation for a public amenity such as a primary school on a plot of land, and also instruct it to grant a development permission for residential purposes thereon without modifying the Development Plan? Could it still be considered as an action following the due process of law merely because a provision of Development Control Rules is relied upon, whether it is applicable or not? Or where the Municipal Corporation is required to take such contrary steps, supposedly on the instructions of the concerned Minister / Chief Minister, for the development of a property for the benefit of his relative, would such instructions amount to interference/mala fide exercise of power? Is it permissible for the landowner and developer to defend the decision of the Government in their favour on the basis of a provision in the erstwhile Town Planning Scheme as against the purpose for which the land is reserved under the presently prevalent Development Plan? Is it permissible for the landowner and developer to explain and justify such a favourable Government decision by relying upon the authority of the Government under another section of the statute which is not even invoked by the Government? What inference is expected to be drawn in such a situation with respect to the role played by the ministers or the municipal officers? What orders are expected to be passed when such facts are brought to the notice of the High Court in a Public Interest Litigation? These are some of the issues which arise in this group of Civil Appeals in the context of the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (for short MR Transfer of Property Act) concerning a property situated in Pune Municipal area.
2. These appeals arise out of two writ petitions in public interest leading to concurrent judgments and a common order dated 6th - 15th March 1999 passed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. These writ petitions bearing Nos. 4433 and 4434 of 1998 were filed respectively by one Vijay Krishna Kumbhar, a journalist and one Nitin Duttatraya Jagtap, a Municipal Corporator of Pune. The petitions pointed out that a particular plot of land bearing Final Plot No. 110 (F.P. No. 110 for short), and admeasuring about 3450 sq. meters, situated on Prabhat Road in the Erandwana area of the city, was initially reserved for a public purpose namely, a garden/playground, and subsequently for a primary school. They further pointed out that a number of years after the Pune Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as PMC) took all the necessary steps to acquire this particular plot of land, the landowner one Dr. Laxmikant Madhav Murudkar appointed M/s Vyas Constructions, a proprietary concern of one Shri Girish Vyas (the Appellant in Civil Appeal No. 198-199 of 2000) as the developer of the property. Shri Girish Vyas is the son-in-law of Shri Manohar Joshi who was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 14.03.1995 till January 1999. The Petitioners contended that only because of the instructions from the Urban Development Department (UDD for short) which was under Shri Manohar Joshi, that in spite of the reservation for a primary school, the plot was permitted to be developed for private residences flouting all norms and mandatory legal provisions. They sought to challenge the building permission which was issued by the PMC under the instructions of the State Government, by submitting that these instructions amounted to interference into the lawful exercise of the powers of the Municipal Corporation, and the same was mala fide. After hearing all concerned, the petitions were allowed, and an order has been passed to cancel the Commencement (of construction) certificates, and Occupation Certificate, and to pull down the concerned building which has been constructed in the meanwhile. The State Government has been directed to initiate criminal investigation against Shri Manohar Joshi, Shri Ravindra Murlidhar Mane, the then Minister of State for UDD, and the then Pune Municipal Commissioner Shri Ram Nath Jha.
3. Being aggrieved by this order, the present group of appeals have been filed:
(i) Civil Appeal Nos. 198-199/ 2000 are filed by the developer Shri Girish Vyas and his proprietary concern M/s Vyas Constructions. Civil Appeal No. 2450 of 2000 is filed by the landowner Dr. Laxmikant Madhav Murudkar (since deceased) to challenge the judgments and the order in their entirety. Their submissions by and large are similar.
(ii) Civil Appeal Nos. 2102-2103 of 2000 are filed by Shri Manohar Joshi, the then Chief Minister, Civil Appeal Nos. 2105-2106 of 2000 are filed by Shri Ram Nath Jha who was the then Pune Municipal Commissioner, and Civil Appeal No. 2120 of 2000 is filed by Shri Ravindra Murlidhar Mane, the then Minister of State, UDD. These appeals seek to expunge the adverse remarks against the Appellants, and the order directing criminal investigation against them.
(iii) Civil Appeal Nos. 196-197 of 2000 are filed by Maruti Raghu Sawant and Ors. who were the tenants in this property. They contend that in the scheme prepared by the developer, they were to become owners of their tenements whereas under the original reservation, they were to be evicted.
We may note at this stage that though the PMC accepts the judgment, it has no objection to the tenants continuing as tenants of PMC in the building which is constructed for accommodating them on a portion of the very plot of land. The tenants, however, contend that if the plot of land is taken over by PMC, they will remain mere tenants as against the ownership rights which were assured to them by the developer and the landlord, and are, therefore, continuing to maintain their appeals.
4. All these appeals are opposed and the impugned judgment and order are defended by the original Petitioners as well as by the PMC and the State Government. It is relevant to note that the State of Maharashtra as well as PMC had opposed the writ petitions in the High Court, but they have not filed any appeals and have now accepted the judgment and order as it is. Since, all these appeals are arising out of the same judgment and order, they have been heard and are being decided together, by treating the appeals filed by Shri Girish Vyas as the lead appeals.
Facts leading to these appeals
Reservation on F.P. No. 110 for a garden
5. Dr. Laxmikant Madhav Murudkar (since deceased), Appellant in Civil Appeal No. 2450 of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as landowner) owned the property bearing F.P. No. 110. The Government of Maharashtra sanctioned a Development Plan for Pune City by publishing a notification dated 7.7.1966 in the official gazette dated 8.7.1966, which fixed 15.8.1966 as the date on which the said plan shall come into force. (The said plan is hereinafter referred to as 1966 D.P. Plan). Under the said 1966 D.P. Plan, F.P. No. 110-112 were reserved for a garden. The Plan was sanctioned in exercise of the power of the State Government under Section 10 of the then Prevalent Bombay Town Planning Act 1954 (1954 Act for short). This notification stated that the PMC had passed the necessary resolution of its intention to prepare a Development Plan, carried out the necessary survey, considered the suggestions received from the members of the public under Section 9 of the Act, and after modifying the Plan wherever found necessary, submitted it to the Government, and thereafter the Government having consulted the Director of Town Planning, had in exercise of its power under Section 10(1) and (2) of the Act, sanctioned the Development Plan.
6. Subsequently, the 1954 Act was repealed and replaced by the MR Transfer of Property Act with effect from 11.01.1967. However, by virtue of Section 165(2) of MR Transfer of Property Act, the 1966 D.P. Plan was saved. Consequently, when the landowner applied for the sanction of a layout in F.P. No. 110, the same was rejected by PMC. Therefore, the landowner served on the State Government a notice dated 8th May 1979 under Section 49(1) of the MR Transfer of Property Act, calling upon it to purchase the land and to "commence the proceedings for acquisition". The notice stated that the F.P. No. 110 was not acquired within the period of 10 years granted to the Planning Authority to implement the D.P. (for the Pune Municipal area, PMC is the Planning Authority). It further stated that as per his understanding, the D.P. was under revision but the reservation on Petitioner's F.P. No. 110 had not been changed, and 'the reservation will never be cancelled and the final plot will never be handed back' to him. The State Government confirmed the purchase notice under Section 49(4) of the Act by its letter dated 5.12.1979. The Government's letter informed the landowner that necessary instructions have been issued to the PMC, and he may approach their office.
Steps for acquisition of F.P. No. 110
7. The standing committee of the PMC thereafter passed a resolution on 5.1.1980 to initiate the proposal for acquisition. The PMC then forwarded the proposal to the Collector of Pune on 9.5.1980 to take the steps for acquisition. On 27.8.1981, the State Government notified the land for acquisition under Section 126 of the MR Transfer of Property Act read with Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 (for short L.A. Act). A Special Land Acquisition Officer (S.L.A.O. for short) was appointed to perform the functions of the Collector. A notice informing the initiation of the proceedings under the L.A. Act as required under Section 9 thereof was issued on 8.9.1981 seeking claims for compensation. The landowner replied to the notice, but did not challenge the acquisition. He filed his claim statement during the acquisition proceeding, and demanded the compensation at the rate of Rs. 480 per sq.m, and also that the material removed after demolition of the temporary structures (of the tenants) on the property should be given to him. Twenty four tenants filed a common claim statement and objected to the acquisition, but did not seek any compensation. They specifically stated that 'there will not be any objection if they are provided with alternative accommodation on the land to be acquired'. The S.L.A.O. passed his award under Section 11 of the L.A. Act on 12.5.1983. He rejected the objections of the tenants, and awarded the compensation of Rs. 100 to each of the 25 tenants. He determined the compensation payable to the landowner at Rs. 6,10,823/-. On 15.3.1985 the landowner withdrew the amount of compensation by furnishing necessary security, though under protest.
8. After the Award was made by the S.L.A.O. on 12.5.1983 as stated earlier, a notice under Section 12(2) of the L.A. Act was given, to take possession of the land on 20.5.1983. Once again, only the tenants objected thereto. They filed a suit on 19.5.1983 in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune, bearing Suit No. 966 of 1983, to challenge the acquisition and the Award. The landowner was joined therein as Defendant No. 3. The Court granted an interim injunction on 19.6.1983, restraining the authorities from taking possession. However, after hearing the parties, an order was passed on 9.2.1984 vacating the injunction, and returning the plaint for failure to give the mandatory notice required under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The tenants filed an appeal to the District Court against that order, but the same was also dismissed. Thereafter, the tenants made a representation to the then Minister of State for UDD, pointing out their difficulties, which persuaded him to pass an administrative order restraining the authorities concerned from taking possession of F.P. No. 110.
9. It is pertinent to note that all along, the landowner did not challenge the acquisition of his land in any manner whatsoever. On the other hand, he sought a Reference under Section 18 of the L.A. Act for enhancement of the compensation. The District Court dismissed that Reference bearing No. 273 of 1983 by order dated 15.4.1988, but enhanced the solarium and additional amount payable under Section 23(2) and 23(1A) of the L.A. Act. The amount payable under the order of the District Court was collected by the landowner, though under protest, but he did not prefer the appeal permissible under Section 54 of the L.A. Act.
Revision of the D.P. Plan for Pune under the MR Transfer of Property Act and change of utilisation of F.P. No. 110 to a Primary school
10. In the meanwhile, the process of revising the Development Plan of Pune city under the provisions of MR Transfer of Property Act was going on. The PMC as the planning authority had passed a resolution on 15.3.1976 declaring its intention to prepare a Revised Development Plan under Section 23(1) read with Section 38 of the MR Transfer of Property Act. The State Government appointed the Director of Town Planning to be the Special Officer for that purpose under Section 162 (1) of that Act. After observing all the legal formalities, the said Director published in the official gazette on 18.9.1982 the Revised Draft Development Plan under Section 26(1) of the Act. In that plan F.P. No. 110-112 were initially reserved for children's play-ground, but subsequently the reservation was changed to primary school. After inviting the objections and suggestions, and after considering them, the State Government sanctioned the Revised D.P. Plan on 5.1.1987 (though with a few modifications), to be effective from 1.1.1987 (hereafter referred as 1987 D.P. Plan for short) as also the Development Control Rules (D.C. Rules for short). In the sanctioned D.P. Plan of 1987, the purpose of utilization of these three plots was, as stated above changed to primary school.
The modification with respect to these three plots was as follows:-
Reservation continued. Development allowed as per note 4. Note 4 reads as follows:
Sites designated for Primary Schools from Sector I to VI as may be decided by the Pune Municipal Corporation may be allowed to be developed by recognized public institutions registered under Public Charitable Trust Act, working in that field or the owners of the land.
Thus by virtue of this note, the purpose could also be effectuated either by the owner of the land, or by a recognized charitable institution.
11. It is relevant to note at this stage that a school for the handicapped children has come up in the adjoining F.P. No. 111. Besides, a primary school was set up by Symbiosis International Cultural and Educational Centre ('Symbiosis' for short) on F.P. No. 112. It is stated that Symbiosis and another educational institution viz. Maharashtra Education Society (MES) had sought these plots since they were in need of land for extension of their educational activities. The then Chief Minister of Maharashtra had recommended the proposal of MES by his letter dated 9.4.1986, and the society had applied to the then Commissioner of Pune by its letter dated 29.4.1986. That was, however, without any effect.
12. The S.L.A.O. gave one more notice to take possession of F.P. No. 110 on 1.3.1988. It led to the filing of Regular Civil Suit bearing No. 397 of 1988 by some of the tenants in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune against the State Government and PMC, once again challenging the award of the S.L.A.O., and seeking an injunction to protect their possession. The Court granted the interim injunction as sought. Thereafter the landowner, who was one of the Defendants in the suit, applied for transposing himself as a Plaintiff, which prayer was allowed on 2.4.1988. The Court accepted the contention of the tenants that the acquisition had lapsed due to the change of purpose of reservation from what it was in 1966 viz. a garden by the time the award was made, and, therefore, decreed the suit by its order dated 23.4.1990.
13. The PMC preferred a first appeal against that decree to the Bombay High Court on 7.1.1991, but the Additional Registrar of the High Court returned the appeal by his order dated 21.4.1992 for presentation to the District Court on the basis of the valuation of the suit, and the provision for jurisdiction as it then existed. Accordingly, the PMC filed the appeal before the District Court immediately on 29.4.1992, but the District Court in turn, by its order passed two years later on 7.4.1994 returned the appeal for re-presenting it to the High Court, on the ground that the suit was valued above Rs. 50,000/- and as per the rules then existing the appeal would lie to the High Court. PMC once again filed the appeal in the High Court being F.A (Stamp) No. 18615 of 1994 on 18.7.1994, along with an Application for condonation of delay for the reasons as stated above. This Appeal remained pending till it was withdrawn on the direction of the State Government on 18.8.1998, in the circumstances which will be presently pointed out. It is, however, relevant to note that this appeal was withdrawn at a point of time when the two public interest petitions were filed on 12.8.1998, and were pending in the High Court. The impugned order of the Division Bench on these petitions has directed the PMC to move an Application before the High Court for reviving the First Appeal (Stamp No. 18615 of 1994), and pursuant thereto the PMC has already moved the necessary Application on 13.1.2000. Be that as it may.
Steps taken by the landowner after Shri Manohar Joshi
took over as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
14. It is material to note that after the decision of the Reference Court, the landowner entered into an agreement of sale of the concerned land with one Shri Mukesh Jain on 17.8.1989, though no steps were taken thereafter by either of the parties on the basis of that agreement. It so happened that consequent upon the elections to the State Assembly, a new Government came in power in the State of Maharashtra in March 1995, and Shri Manohar Joshi took over as the Chief Minister (hereinafter referred as the then Chief Minister). He retained with himself the UDD portfolio. The earlier referred Shri Ravindra Mane became the Minister of State for UDD (hereinafter referred to as the then Minister of State). On 20.10.1995 the landowner entered into a Development agreement with M/s Vyas Constructions by virtue of which the landowner handed over all rights of development in the property to them for a consideration of Rs. 1.25 crores, a flat of 1500 sq. feet area and an office space of 500 sq. feet in the building to be developed on F.P. No. 110. The agreement stated that it was being entered into to solve the practical difficulties. Para 7 thereof stated that the developer shall follow the procedure or process of de-reservation of the said property. Para 20 and 21 stated that 'after de-reservation of the property, the developer agrees to get the clearance under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976 which may be necessary,' and for that purpose he was authorised to get any scheme sanctioned. M/s Vyas Constructions is stated to have settled the claim of above referred Shri Mukesh Jain. On the same day, the landowner executed an irrevocable Power of Attorney in favour of Shri Girish Vyas for the development of F.P No. 110. (He is referred hereinafter as the developer). The landowner simultaneously executed another Power of Attorney in favour of one Shri Shriram Karandikar on 26.10.1995, authorising him to take necessary steps concerning the development of that land.
15. Thereafter, on 1.11.1995 the architect of the landowner submitted to PMC a building layout for permission for residential use of F.P. No. 110. The City Engineer of PMC rejected the proposal by his reply dated 6.11.1995 under Section 45 of the MR Transfer of Property Act read with Section 255 of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act 1949 (BPMC Act for short) and D.C. Rule No. 6.7.1, since the plot had been reserved for a primary school, and hence such a permission could not be granted. It was however pointed out in this reply of the City Engineer that the development of the land was permissible in the manner indicated in the note No. 4 published in the gazette which has been referred to hereinabove (i.e. putting up a primary school either by the landowner or by a charitable trust).
16. At this stage, landowner's Attorney holder, Shri Shriram Karandikar wrote to the Minister of State for UDD on 20.11.1995 seeking a direction to the Municipal Commissioner to sanction landowner's aforesaid application dated 1.11.1995 for development of the property for residential houses. He relied on the decree of Civil Judge Senior Division in Civil Suit No. 399 of 1998 and prayed for correcting the Development Plan also. From here onwards starts the role of the then Minister of State, the Municipal Commissioner, and the then Chief Minister.
Processing of the application dated 20.11.1995 on behalf of the landowner at the
level of the State Government
17. In their petitions to the High Court, the writ Petitioners made the allegation of mala fides on the part of the then Chief Minister and the Minister of State for UDD in entertaining the application made on behalf of the landowner. It, therefore, became necessary for the Division Bench of the High Court to call for the original record from the State Government as well as from the PMC. The application dated 20.11.1995 made by Shri Karandikar on behalf of the landlord narrated the developments until the date of that application including the judgment and decree of the Civil Court setting aside the acquisition of the property. It was, thereafter, submitted that the Municipal Commissioner be directed to sanction the development permission as per the application of the architect of the landowner. It is relevant to note that as far as this application of Shri Karandikar is concerned, it was not addressed to the State Government or to the Secretary of the concerned Department, but directly to the Minister of State for UDD, which fact is noted by the Division Bench in its judgment. The application did not bear any inward stamp of UDD. In the margin of the application, there was a noting by the Private Secretary of the Minister of State for UDD, recording that the Minister had directed the Deputy Secretary, UDD, to call a meeting on 19.1.1996. The record further shows that although the Under Secretary of UDD Shri P.V. Ghadge accordingly called the initial meeting, by addressing a letter to the Director, Town Planning and the Municipal Commissioner, the same was adjourned to 22.1.1996. On that date, the meeting was attended by the Director of Town Planning, the Deputy City Engineer of PMC, Deputy Director of Town Planning, Pune, as well as by Shri Karandikar and his advocate, but what happened in that meeting is not reflected in this file.
Initial Stand of Urban Development Department and PMC
18. The Under Secretary (Shri P.V. Ghadge) prepared a preliminary note dated 2.2.1996 for the subsequent meeting. At the outset, the note mentions in a nutshell the background for the meeting which was sought on behalf of the landlord. Thereafter it gives the initial opinion of the U.D. Department at the end of the note, which is as follows:
In this regard it is the advice of the department that, acquisition has been done after taking action on the purchase notice. The compensation amount has been accepted. Even if the reservation of the plot is changed, it does not make any difference. Directions be given to the Pune Municipal Corporation to immediately present this matter in the Bombay High Court. The question of returning the plot to the land owner does not arise.
19. On the background of this departmental note containing its advice, a meeting was held on 3.2.1996 presided over by the Minister of State for UDD, and the minutes of the meeting are part of the record placed before the High Court. Apart from Shri Karandikar and his advocate, high ranking officers such as (i) Secretary, UDD, (ii) Director, Town Planning, (iii) Commissioner, PMC, (iv) City Engineer, PMC and (v) Under Secretary, UDD were present in the meeting. The minutes of the meeting are recorded by the Under Secretary.
20. These minutes record that in this meeting the advocate of the applicant explained the facts leading to his client's application, justifying as to why the reservation on the land may be deleted. He referred to the Court proceedings, the fact that 25-30 tenants were residing on the property for many years, and that on the adjoining property a school was running. He therefore submitted that the reservation on the land be deleted.
21. The note records a preliminary query raised by the Secretary, UDD as to whether the advocate was pleading on behalf of the tenants or the landowner, to which the Advocate replied that he was pleading for the landowner. The Secretary, UDD raised two more queries viz. (i) if the land was not useful for reservation because of the tenants, then how will it be available to the landowner, and (ii) whether the landowner had ever objected to this reservation, to which the advocate replied in the negative.
22. The City Engineer, PMC pointed out during the meeting that consequent upon the property owner issuing the purchase notice, the PMC had acquired the land, the award was made, the property owner had accepted the compensation, and that he never objected to the change in reservation due to the revision of the D.P. Plan during the entire period of revision i.e. 1982-87. With respect to the proceedings initiated by the tenants, he pointed that PMC had filed an Appeal in the Bombay High Court against the judgment of the Civil Court, and the matter was sub-judice. He specifically asked whether the hearing given to the applicant was on an appeal under Section 47 of the MR Transfer of Property Act, or was it on his application. He pointed out that the property was under reservation, and it could not be de-reserved in an appeal under Section 47. It required an action in the nature of modification under Section 37 of the MR Transfer of Property Act. If it was an appeal, then it may be rejected, and if it was an application for modification then a decision cannot be taken as the matter was sub-judice. On these queries it was stated on behalf of the landowner that his application was a request and not an appeal.
Directions by Minister of State and report made by the
Municipal Commissioner in pursuance thereof
23. It was thereafter pointed out on behalf of landowner that on the adjoining two plots, schools had been developed, and the Corporation may not need this land. The note records that in view of this submission, the Minister of State, UDD asked the Municipal Commissioner to examine whether the PMC really needed the concerned property. He also suggested that it be examined, if PMC can keep some portion of the land under reservation, and release the remaining to the landowner. If such a compromise is to be arrived at, then the property owner will have to accommodate the tenants on a portion of property released to him. If PMC did not have any objection to reduce the area under reservation, Government will issue the necessary direction to take action under Section 37. The note records at that stage, that the Municipal Commissioner pointed out that the permission of the Municipal Corporation (meaning the general body) was necessary to either delete the reservation, or to reduce the area under reservation.
24. The file shows that accordingly the Under Secretary wrote to the Municipal Commissioner on 14.2.1996 requesting him to examine the possibility regarding any settlement after a site inspection, and to forward his opinion. He was also asked to inform as to when had the PMC filed its appeal in the Bombay High Court, and about its status.
25. The file shows that at this stage, the landowner changed his stand. Shri Karandikar wrote another letter dated 23.3.1996 to the Minister of State that his application be treated as an appeal under Section 47 of the MR Transfer of Property Act.
26. The Municipal Commissioner replied Government's letter dated 14.2.1996 by his letter dated 17.4.1996. He pointed out that the development permission for this particular plot had been rejected because the property was under reservation. Then he reiterated the position of PMC as stated in the meeting of 3.2.1996. Then he added -
On 3.2.1996 we took the same stand which was taken by us in various counts and administrative levels regarding dispute for the development of property, and that if any change is proposed in the use of the said property, permission has to be taken from the Pune Municipal Corporation. The Hon'ble Minister of State for urban development ordered us to survey the subject property and also ordered to explore the options of changing or reducing the area of the reservation.
27. The Municipal Commissioner then stated that before considering the various options as directed by the State Government, it was necessary to note the background of the subject property; viz. that as per the 1966 D.P. Plan, it was reserved for a garden, and subsequently the reservation was changed to a Primary School in the draft D.P. Plan of 1982 confirmed in 1987. He referred to the litigation initiated by the tenants, the fact that the PMC had filed an appeal to the High Court against the decision in the Civil Suit No. 397/1988, and that the High Court sent back the matter to the District Court and it was pending there. He placed on record the fact that though full price of the land was paid to the owner, procedure of taking actual possession by the PMC was still pending for last 13 years, because of which it was not possible to make appropriate use of the land. The Minister had asked him to survey the subject property, and to explore the possibility of changing or reducing the area of reservation. The commissioner pointed out that a survey was carried accordingly. He recorded that on inspection following facts were mainly noted:
1. There are about 36 temporary Houses on the land.
2. Out of the total area nearly half is encumbered.
3. Two Educational Institutions in the vicinity of the School.
4. There are 11 Educational Institutions in the vicinity of the School.
5. Except the temporary Houses on this property the development of the area is planned and corporation has control over it.
The Commissioner however, did not specify as to which area of the city was considered by him when he spoke about 'vicinity' in item No. 4 above.
28. The land was to be developed either by PMC or the owner or by a Charitable Trust as per the D.P. Note 4 referred to above. The Municipal Commissioner then gave his opinion that development of a primary school on that plot by a charitable institution appeared impossible due to various factors such as the order of the Civil Court, litigation concerning this plot, the requirement of rehabilitation of the tenants on that plot, and existence of near-by schools. Besides, the area being a higher middle class area, the response to a municipal school was doubtful. He then added as follows -'considering the funds available, the PMC is inclined to develop school on some other plot reserved for school'. As we have noted earlier two well-known educational institutions, viz. MES and Symbiosis had already sought this plot also. The PMC had however replied to them that it was not possible for it to give them this plot, since it was not in the possession of PMC. The Municipal Commissioner failed to bring these very relevant facts to the notice of the Government. Having noticed these facts, the Division Bench has observed in para 143 of its judgment that the Commissioner's statement in this behalf in his report was "far from truth.
29. The Commissioner then recorded that in view of the direction of the State Government to suggest alternatives for settlement, he had in the meanwhile, held discussions with Shri Karandikar, and that Shri Karandikar had expressed readiness to give alternate unencumbered land within suburbs of Pune admeasuring 5000 to 10000 sq. feet free of cost. Thereafter, in view of the direction of the State Government and proposals from Shri Karandikar, the Commissioner recorded two suggestions:
1. Presently reserved area is about 3541 sq.mtrs out of which nearly 50% area is occupied by occupants and remaining area is open. The land owner after excluding the area occupied by the existing houses, to transfer the remaining area to the Pune Municipal Corporation for school. However, since the land owner has accepted compensation for the entire area, for the area to be transferred, he should refund the amount to the Pune Municipal Corporation at the rate suggested by the Director of Town Planning.
2. To get transferred land admeasuring 3000 sq.mtrs elsewhere at a convenient place in Pune City with school admeasuring 500 sq.mtrs constructed thereon free of cost as per specifications of the Pune Municipal Corporation, and for that purpose it is necessary to get executed a proper agreement. But land to be given elsewhere should not be reserved in development plan for school or some other purpose.
Thereafter his letter stated as follow:
If first proposal is to be accepted for developing school on remaining area question regarding decision of Civil Judge, Senior Division would arise. In this situation it is necessary to have the support of the land owner and tenants for this proposal. For implementing both the aforesaid proposals suggested by us it would be appropriate if the following things are complied with:
1. The Pune Municipal Corporation administration to take permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation before releasing rights in respect of the subject property.
2. For deleting reservation on the property taking action under Section 37 of M.R.T.P.
3. For acquiring new site as per Proposal No. 2 permission of concerned Departments of the Pune Municipal Corporation will have to be taken.
Then the Commissioner added:
Prior to this since no such settlement matters have taken place regarding the development plan of Pune Municipal Corporation, the experience of Pune Municipal Corporation in this regard is limited. Till the next order is received from the State Government the Pune Municipal Corporation is continuing the judicial procedure in respect of this land.
30. After the receipt of the letter dated 17.4.1996 from the Municipal Commissioner, the file shows the following noting dated 24.4.1996:
Mantralaya, Bombay 400 032
Date 24/4/1996
According to the instructions of Shri Chavan, Private Secretary of the Hon'ble Chief Minister, please forward a copy of the report of the Pune Municipal Corporation in the matter of Shri Karandikar for the perusal of the Hon'ble Chief Minister.

31. On receiving the above reply dated 17.4.1996 from Municipal Commissioner, Shri Ghadge, the Under Secretary once again put up a detailed note thereon. In first 8 paragraphs of that note he recorded the previous developments, including and up to the letter sent by the Municipal Commissioner. Thereafter in paragraph 9, 10 and 11 he put up the proposal of the department:
9. Considering the entire aforesaid circumstances, it is firstly pointed out that applicant Shri Karandikar has approached the Government on behalf of the land owner but the land owner has already taken the price of the said property in the year 1983. Though the physical possession of the said property is not received to the Municipal Corporation still however, legally Municipal Corporation has become owner of the said property. Therefore, the Land Owner does not have any right to demand return of the said property by deleting reservation. Now considering the tenants, they have approached the Court and therefore, it is not necessary to consider that aspect till the matter is decided by the Court. If the said matter is decided against the Municipal Corporation still the said persons shall be tenants and the land owner shall be Municipal Corporation and further that the tenants have requested for allotment of the land for developing it.
10. Still however considering the fact that no way out will be available if the matter is kept pending as it is, and further considering that there are numerous schools in the vicinity of the said property, there should be no objection to consider and approve on government level the alternative No. 1 suggested by the Municipal Commissioner. However, for the said purpose the tenants will have to withdraw their proceedings from the Court and they will have to pay to the Municipal Corporation the cost price of the 50% portion to be released for the said tenants as may be determined by the Director, Town Planning. If the said alternative is acceptable to the land owner, the Pune Municipal Corporation be informed about the orders of the Government to initiate proceedings Under Section 37 for the purposes of deletion of 50% property from reservation and to forward the said proposal to the Government.
11. Second alternative does not deserve any consideration since for shifting the reservation the alternative property should have the same area like that of the original one and that it is necessary that such property should be in the vicinity of approximately 200 mtrs. from the property under reservation. So also the matters like approach road and level of the land are also required to be similar. (MARGINAL REMARK - Rule No. 13.5 of Pune Development Control Rules).
12. Proposal in paragraph 10 submitted for approval.
The note was countersigned by Shri Deshpande, Deputy Secretary, Town Planning on 4.6.1996, and by the Senior Chief Secretary (NV i.e. Nagar Vikas or Urban Development). Thus the Urban Development Department did not accept the second proposal of the Municipal Commissioner to remove the reservation on the plot in its entirety, but recommended the acceptance of the first proposal to reduce the reservation on the plot to 50% of its area. The Minister for State however did not sign the note and he ordered a further discussion on the subject on 12.6.1996.
32. Thus there was once again a discussion with the Minister of State, UDD on 12.6.1996 when Shri Karandikar, Shri Harihar, City Engineer, PMC, Shri Deshpande, Deputy Secretary, Town Planning and Shri Ghadge, Under Secretary were present. Shri Ghadge made a note of the meeting and signed it on 13.6.1996, and which note is also signed by Shri Deshpande and the Additional Chief Secretary. The note records that on behalf of the applicants it was stated that it was not possible for them to accept the alternative No. 1, and Municipal Corporation should consider the second alternative. The note further records that thereupon the City Engineer suggested that if the applicant shows some other alternative properties, the Municipal Corporation will inspect all of them and then consider as to which of them is possible to be accepted. The note thereafter records as follows:
In the event such alternative property is selected by Municipal Corporation, then action to be taken for shifting the reservation from the subject property as per Rule No. 13.5 of Pune Development Control Rules can be considered. However, it was clarified by the Department that for that purpose the condition of 200 mtr. Distance will have to be relaxed and for which the permission of Hon. Chief Minister will have to be obtained.
The PMC was thereafter asked to submit its response in the light of above discussion. Shri Ghadge recorded this suggestion in his letter dated 20.6.1996 addressed to the Municipal Commissioner.
33. The Municipal Commissioner then wrote back to the Under Secretary, UDD by his letter dated 15.7.1996, pointing out that the applicant had shown four sites from which one at Lohegaon Survey No. 261 H. No. 1/2 admeasuring 3000 sq.meter was suitable for a primary school, but it was in the Agricultural zone as per the approved D.P., and if it was to be converted to Residential zone, the approval of the State Government will have to be obtained for such a modification.
34. On receiving this letter from the Municipal Commissioner, Shri Ghadge once again put up a detailed note and at the end of para 8 thereof stated as follows:
Considering the above circumstances and especially 'A" on 12 T.V. and B on 14 T.V., there could be no objection in granting permission for shifting reservation under Rule 13.5 of the D.C. Rules by relaxing the 200 meter condition and accordingly directions can be given to the PMC for taking the following necessary action:
1. The Pune Municipal Corporation should recover the amount of compensation paid earlier, for acquisition of final plot No. 110 at Earndwane together with the structures, with simple interest.
2. The State Government should issue directions to the Pune Municipal Corporation for getting the plot at Lohegaon, Pune Survey No. 261 Hissa No. 1/2 from Agricultural zone into residential zone by following the procedure under Section 37(1) of the Maharastra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and thereafter submitting the proposal to the State Government for sanction.
3. The Commissioner Pune Municipal Corporation should take action for shifting the reservation for Primary School on Final Plot No. 110 in the Development Plan of Pune City under Rule 13.5 of the Development Control Rules, Pune to Lohegaon, Survey No. 261, Hissa No. 1/2 and for that purpose the permission of the Corporation is not necessary as intimated earlier by the State Government in another case (Survey No. 39/1, Kothrud, Pune).
4. After complying with (1) and (3) above, the Pune Municipal Corporation should enter into an Agreement for transfer of the land at Lohegaon Pune and thereafter give development permission for the plot at Erandwane. However the Completion Certificate for that place should not be issued unless the construction of School at Lohegaon is completed.

35. In view of the above decision signed by the Chief Minister on 21.8.1996, the Deputy Secretary, UDD sent a letter/order dated 3.9.1996 to the Commissioner containing exactly the above four conditions. The letter stated that he had been ordered by the State Government to inform those four directives, and after quoting those four directives the letter further directed the Corporation to act as per the above State Government directives and report compliance. The letter reads as follows:

I have been ordered by the State Government to communicate to you the following directives.
1. The Pune Municipal Corporation should recover from the land owner according to the land acquisition law the principal amount paid for acquisition of Final Ploat No. 110, Erandwane along with construction, with interest thereon at 12%.
2. S. No. 261 Hissa No. 1/2 Lohegaon, Pune which is in agricultural zone should be included within residential zone in the Development Plan. For doing this you are directed that Pune Municipal Corporation should complete the entire legal action under Section 37(1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and send the proposals to the State Government for sanction.
3. The Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation should take steps to shift the reservation of primary school in accordance with Rule 13.5 of the Development Control Rules from Final Plot No. 110, Erandwane to Lohegaon S.

Yours faithfully,

Vidyadhar Deshpande
Deputy Secretary
Nothings from the Municipal Files:
36. Thereafter we have the nothings from the Municipal files which show that consequently the City Engineer has written to landowner on 27.9.1996 to return the amount paid to him for acquisition of final Plot No. 110 T.P. Scheme, No. 1 with interest at the rate of 12%, and secondly to transfer concerned land bearing survey No. 261 Hissa No. 1/2 at Lohegaon free of cost and without any encumbrances. The letter further stated that only after compliance of the above two conditions he will be given permission for development of F.P. No. 110. It then stated that building completion certificate will be given only after the procedure under Section 37 (1) of the MR Transfer of Property Act for deleting Survey No. 261 Hissa 2/1 at Lohegaon, Hadapsar from the agricultural zone, and reserving it for primary school is completed, and sanctioned by the State Government.
37. Thereafter there is one more note of the Municipal Commissioner dated 21.9.1996 which records the opinion of the Senior Law Officer that the permission of the general body of PMC will be required for entering into an agreement for deleting the reservation of plot at Erandawana. With respect to the same the commissioner has recorded as follows:
However, since the State Government has given clear orders to take action under Rule 13.5 of the Development Control Rules of Pune for complying with the subject matters and since directives have been given for making such change, no permission of the Pune Municipal Corporation is necessary.
Subsequent Developments
38. Consequently, the subsequent steps have been taken. The landowner has returned the amount as sought, a deed of settlement has been entered into between the landowner and the PMC, and Commencement Certificates have been issued on 28.11.1996 and 3.5.1997 for the two buildings proposed to be constructed. An Occupation Certificate dated 20.12.1997 was also given for a part of the building completed thereafter namely, B Wing containing 24 flats for the tenants. It is however interesting to note that PMC instructed its counsel on 19.11.1996 to withdraw its first appeal in the High Court as directed by the Government even before the landowner returning the amount of compensation with interest on 22.11.1996.
39. It has so transpired that though the land at Lohegaon was handed over to PMC as proposed, subsequently the Municipal Corporation found that there was not so much need of a school at Lohegaon, but a school was needed at Sinhagad Road, Dattawadi. The procedure for changing the zone of the land at Lohegaon as required under Section 37 of the MR Transfer of Property Act was also taking its own time at the municipal level. Once again there was a correspondence between the PMC and the Government in this behalf. The Commissioner wrote to the Dy. Secretary, UDD on 28.5.1998 for a modification in the conditions in the Government letter dated 3.9.1996 to get the school constructed at Dattawadi (instead of Lohegaon) in lieu of the school reservation on plot No. 110 at Prabhat road. At this stage for the first time we have the letter from the developer dated 15.7.1998 addressed to the City Engineer of PMC signed by Shri Girish Vyas for the Vyas Constructions, stating that he was prepared to offer an alternative site admeasuring 3000 sq. meters at Mundhwa within PMC area which is in residential zone. This was to avoid the difficulty concerning the change of zone. Additionally he was prepared to deposit an amount with PMC equivalent to the cost of construction of 500 sq. meters as per PMC's standard specifications, and PMC may construct the school whenever and wherever it required. He further sought that on his doing so, the final completion certificate be issued so that the flat purchasers can occupy their flats in the building on F.P. No. 110 which was almost ready.
40. The Government file contains one more note made by the Under Secretary Shri Rajan Kop and signed by Shri Deshpande on 22.7.1998. It is clearly recorded below the note that it was marked for the Additional Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister, and also for the Chief Minister. The note mentions that there has been substantial criticism in local newspaper about this matter. It is stated that the issue was raised in the general body of PMC, and it was represented that an amenity in the area is being destroyed by deleting the reservation for a primary school. The Commissioner had defended the decision by contending that although 3450 sq. meter area of reservation of F.P. No. 110 was being deleted, reservation on 8219 sq. meters on adjoining two plots was being maintained. It was also pointed out by the Commissioner that an additional amenity was being created in another area. The note further records that in the meanwhile the proposal to shift the reservation on the plot at Lohegaon had been filed (i.e. disapproved) by the Standing Committee of PMC. Last para of this note states as follows:
Senior Chief Secretary of Hon. Chief Minister has issued instructions to put up a self explanatory note in this entire matter for perusal of Hon. Chief Minister. It is further instructed to include the matters wherein the Government has taken a decision in this matter as also in another matter prior thereto, the information provided and points suggested by Municipal Corporation with respect to the matters of deletion of reservation from Pune City Development Plan, etc., Such note containing the full background, factual and other aspects of the matter would be useful for Hon. Chief Minister if certain questions are raised with respect to the said matter in the current session of Legislative Assembly.
41. On receiving the developer's letter dated 15.7.1998, the Commissioner once again wrote to Under Secretary UDD on 23.7.1998 suggesting acceptance of the two proposals of the developer, but seeking orders of the government therefore. It is material to note at this stage that in the Government file there is a clear noting of the Principal Secretary UDD dated 24.7.1998 that the application of Rule 13.5 in the matter under question was not legal. As the note states:
...With due respect to the persons then, doing interpretation of the said decision of the Government and Rule No. 13.5, I feel that application of Rule No. 13.5 in the matter under question is not legal. Upon plain reading of the said rule it is clear that this rule can be applied when the reservation is to be shifted within a distance of 200 mtrs. Government or the Commissioner do not appear to be empowered for such shifting beyond the distance of 200 mtrs. It would have been much appropriate that the action for change as contemplated in Section 37 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 would have been taken...
42. In view of Commissioner's letter dated 23.7.1998 however, once again a departmental note was prepared containing following opinion, still seeking to resort to Rule 13.5.
... After considering this issue the following opinion is being expressed on the proposal of Pune Municipal Corporation.
(1) Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation to take action to cancel the action earlier taken of shifting reservation at Lohegaon as per Rule No. 13.5 and the action of shifting the said part reservation to Mundhawa be initiated afresh under Rule 13.5.
(2) Prior to taking action as stated in (1) above, even though it is stated by the Commissioner that the land at Mundhwa admeasuring 3000 sq. mtrs., suggested by the Promoter is suitable, still however, it is necessary that the Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation should get himself satisfied about the 12 mtr. wide approach being available to the said land. After satisfying itself the legal action for taking the said Mundhwa land in possession of the Pune Municipal Corporation be completed. After completing these actions only, it is necessary to take action as stipulated in (1) above.
(3) As per the earlier instructions, the Pune Municipal Corporation got executed agreement for construction of 500 sq.mtrs. Since the action with respect to Lohegaon land had remained incomplete, the Municipal Corporation could not grant permission to construct school therein. This construction could have been got done on Mundhwa land. However, from the letter of the Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation it is seen that he has not yet decided as to whether the school is to be constructed on the said land or not. On the other hand he has asserted that since the Promoter is ready to pay such amount of construction no loss would be caused to Municipal Corporation by getting deposited such amount. Considering this issue, principally there appears to be no objection on the part of the Commissioner in accepting the proposal of promoter as recommended by him with a view to get available the necessary amenity for the school as per their requirements. However, it would be binding upon the Commissioner to spend the said amount for the construction at such place which may be found necessary and as may be recommended by the Education Committee.
(4) Since the actions to be taken as stipulated in point No. (3) above, are between the Pune Municipal Corporation Education Committee and Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation, there is no reason to suspend the action of granting completion certification to the Promoter therefore. Therefore, the Government shall have no objection if the completion certificate is granted by Municipal Corporation to the Promoter after completing the actions as stipulated in para No. 1 and 2 subject to the rules and provisions in that behalf.
If the aforesaid issues are approved, the proposal of the Commissioner in the present circumstances being FOR superior purpose than these contained in the earlier directives of the Government there should be no reason to object the proposal submitted by the Commissioner and the same ought to be principally approval subject however, to the conditions mentioned in the aforesaid discussion. In accordance hereof the draft or letter to be sent to Pune Municipal Corporation is put up at Page No. _/PV.
The above proposal will be issued on the same being approved.
Submitted for orders.

43. Below this note however, the Additional Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister put up a remark as follows and signed below it:
In this matter the developer and Hon. Chief Minister being related, it is requested that the Hon. Minister of State should take proper decision as per rules.
Thereafter there is the order of the Minister of State which is as follows:
Proposal of Department approved. Orders be issued:
Sd/
28.7.98
N.V.V.
44. The Deputy Secretary thereafter sent a reply dated 29.7.1998 to the letters of the Municipal Commissioner dated 28.5.1998 and 23.7.1998. In para 1 thereof he referred to the Commissioner's letter dated 28.5.1998 seeking to shift reservation on F.P. No. 110 under DC Rule 13.5 to Mundhawa instead of Lohegaon. Thereafter he stated in para 2 as follows:
...Now the Developer has shown his readiness to make available land at Mundhawa. Therefore, in your letter you have sought approval to recover the proper amount required for the construction of 500 sq.mtrs, after taking action stated in preceding paragraph. Upon due consideration of your request, I have orders to inform you that after recovering such proper amount from the Developer, the said amount be utilized for construction of primary school at such place as may be required and recommended by the Education Committee of Pune Municipal Corporation. Because of this order request made by you in your letter dt. 28.5.98 automatically becomes redundant.
In your letter dt. 23rd July 98 you have sought guidance on the issue of grant of occupancy certificate to the Developer. After taking the action as stated in paragraph 1 and 2, there is no reason for the Government to have objection if in furtherance thereof the Pune Municipal Corporation issues the occupancy certificate subject to the other provisions of the Rules in that behalf.
45. In view of the directions dated 3.9.1996 issued by the State Government, the PMC issued (i) Commencement Certificate (C.C. for short) in the name of the landowner dated 28.11.1996 for constructing a building to rehabilitate the tenants, (ii) the second C.C. dated 3.5.1997 for constructing the other residential buildings consisting of ground plus ten floors (named as Sundew Apartment by the developer), and (iii) the Occupation Certificate (O.C. for short) in part dated 20.12.1997 for the tenants' building. Thereafter, the developer signed a confirming agreement with the landowner and his family members on 16.1.1998 to once again confirm the terms of the earlier referred development agreement entered into between the developer and landowner on 20.10.1995. It is at this stage, that two petitions bearing No. 4433/1998 and 4434/1998 were filed on 12.8.1998 and 14.8.1998 respectively. A Division Bench first issued Rule Nisi without any interim order. In as much as the construction had started from March 1997 and was substantially completed, only a direction was given in Writ Petition No. 4434/1998 not to create any third party interest. The PMC was already directed not to grant completion certificate in respect of the ten storey building. Subsequently, the petitions were heard finally, and the Division Bench consisting of Hon'ble Justice B.N. Srikrishna and Justice S.S Parkar, rendered two concurrent judgments on 6th-15th March 1999, and a common order which have been challenged in the present group of appeals.
Justification of the shifting of reservation under D.C. Rule 13.5: Is it in consonance with the statute
46. As we have noted, the State Government directed the PMC to shift the reservation on F.P. No. 110 under DC Rule 13.5. The question therefore comes up as to whether the action by the State is in consonance with the statutory scheme, and that apart whether such an action is permissible under DC Rule 13.5? If we look to the scheme of the Act it gives importance to the implementation of the sanctioned plan as it is and it is only in certain contingencies that the provision there under is permitted to be modified, and that too after following the necessary procedure made in that behalf.
Signification of the Sanctioned Plan and the provisions for the modification thereof
47. The Planning process under the MR Transfer of Property Act is quite an elaborate process. A number of town planners, architects and officers of the Planning Authority, and wherever necessary those of the State Government participate in the process. They take into consideration the requirements of the citizens and the need for the public amenities. The planners consider the difficulties presently faced by the citizens, make rough estimate of the likely growth of the city in near future and provide for their solutions. The plan is expected to be implemented during the course of the next twenty years. After the draft Development Plan is prepared, a notice is published in the official gazette stating that the plan is prepared. Under Section 26(1) of the Act the name and place where copy thereof will be available for inspection to the public at large is notified. Copies and extracts thereof are also made available for sale. Thereafter suggestions and objections are invited. The provisions of regional plan are given due weight age under Section 27 of the Act and then the plan is finalised after following the detailed process under Section 28 of the Act. This being the position, Chapter-III of the MR Transfer of Property Act on Development Plans requires the sanctioned plan to be implemented as it is. There are only two methods by which modifications of the final Development Plan can be brought about. One is where the proposal is such that it will not change the character of the Development Plan, which is known as minor modification and for which the procedure is laid down under Section 37 of the Act. The other is where the modification is of a substantial nature which is defined under Section 22A of the Act. In that case the procedure as laid down under Section 29 is required to be followed. There is also one more analogous provision though it is slightly different i.e. the one provided under Section 50 of the Act, for deletion of the reservation where the appropriate authority (other than the planning authority) no longer requires the designated land for the particular public purpose, and seeks deletion of the reservation thereon.
48. The Government's action to shift the reservation on F.P. No. 110 is under DC Rule 13.5 and not under Section 37 of the MR Transfer of Property Act. We may therefore refer to DC Rule 13.5 and Section 37.
DC Rule 13.5 reads as follows:
13.5 If the land proposed to be laid out is affected by any reservation/s or public purpose/s authority may agree to adjust the location of such reservation/s to suit the development without altering the area of such reservation. Provided however, that no such shifting of the reservation/s shall be permitted.
(a) beyond 200 m. of the location in the Development Plan.
(b) beyond the holding of the owner in which such reservation is located, and
(c) unless the alternative location is at least similar to the location of the Development Plan as regards access, levels etc.
All such alterations in the reservations/alignment of roads shall be reported by the Planning Authority to Govt. at the time of sanctioning the layout.
49. As can be seen from the D.C. Rule 13.5, shifting of the reservation there under has to be without altering the size of the area under reservation. Besides it is permissible only on three conditions namely, that (1) it cannot be beyond 200 metres of the original location in the Development Plan, (2) it has to be within the holding of the owner in which the reservation is located, and (3) the alternative location ought to have a similar access and land level as the original location. Obviously the shifting of the reservation from F.P. No. 110 to a far off place could not be justified under D.C. Rule 13.5.
Minor Modifications
50. Section 37 of the MR Transfer of Property Act, reads as follows:
37. Modification of final Development Plan
(1) Where a modification of any part of or any proposal made in, a final Development plan is of such a nature that it will not change the character of such Development plan, the Planning Authority may, or when so directed by the State Government (shall, within sixty days from the date of such direction, publish a notice) in the Official Gazette (and in such other manner as may be determined by it) inviting objections and suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed modification not later than One month from the date of such notice; and shall also serve notice on all persons affected by the proposed modification and after giving a hearing to any such persons, submit the proposed modification (with amendments, if any), to the State Government for sanction.
(1A) If the Planning Authority fails to issue the notice as directed by the State Government, the State Government shall issue the notice, and thereupon the provisions of Sub-section (1) shall apply as they apply in relation to a notice to be published by a Planning Authority.
(1AA) (a) Notwithstanding anything Contained in Sub-sections (1), (1A) and (2), where the State Government is satisfied that in the public interest it is necessary to carry out urgently a modification of any part of, or any proposal made in, a final Development Plan of such a nature that it will not change the character of such Development Plan, the State Government may, on its own, publish a notice in the Official Gazette, and in such other manner as may be determined by it, inviting objections and suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed modification not later than one month from the date of such notice and shall also serve notice on all persons affected by the proposed modification and the Planning Authority.
(b) The State Government shall, after the specified period, forward a copy of all such objections and suggestions to the Planning Authority for its say to the Government within a period of one month from the receipt of the copies of such objections and suggestions from the Government.
(c) The State Government shall, after giving hearing to the affected persons and the Planning Authority and after making such inquiry as it may consider necessary and consulting the Director of Town Planning, by notification in the Official Gazette, publish the approved modifications with or without changes, and subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, or may decide not to carry out such modification. On the publication of the modification in the Official Gazette, the final Development Plan shall be deemed to have been modified accordingly.
(1-B) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), if the Slum Rehabilitation Authority appointed under Section 3A of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971(Mah. XXV-III of 1971) is satisfied that a modification of any part of, or any proposal made in, a final Development Plan is required to be made for implementation of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme declared under the said Act, then, it may publish a notice in the Official Gazette, and in such other manner as may be determined by it, inviting objections and suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed modification not later than one month from the date of such notice; and shall also serve notice on all persons affected by the proposed modification, and after giving a hearing to any such persons, submit the proposed modification (with amendments, if any) to the State Government for sanction.
(2) The State Government may, (make such inquiry as it may consider necessary) and after consulting the Director of Town Planning by notification in the Official Gazette, sanction the modification * * * with or without such changes, and subject to such conditions as it may deem fit or refuse to accord sanction. If a modification is sanctioned, the final Development Plans shall be deemed to have been modified accordingly.
51. As seen from this Section, the minor modification under Section 37(1) has to be such that it will not change the character of the Development Plan. The section indicates that for setting the procedure under Section 37 into motion, the Planning Authority has to firstly form an opinion that the proposed modification will not change the character of the Development Plan. Such an opinion has to be formed by the Planning Authority meaning the general body of the Municipal Corporation, since this function is not permitted to be delegated to anybody else under Section 152 of the Act. Thereafter the Planning Authority has to publish a notice in the official gazette inviting the objections and suggestions from the public with respect to the proposed modification. It is also required to give a notice to all the persons affected by the proposed modification. Sub-section (1A) lays down that if the Planning Authority does not give the notice, the State Government is required to issue the notice as stated above. The notice to the affected persons in our case will mean notice at least to the two institutions which had applied for developing a Primary school on this very plot of land. Thereafter they have to be heard, and the proposed modification with amendments if any, is to be submitted to the State Government for sanction. Subsequently, after making appropriate enquiries and after consulting the Director of Town Planning the State Government may under Sub-section (2) sanction the modification with or without appropriate changes, or subject to such conditions as it may deem fit or refuse to grant the sanction.
52. Sub-section (1AA) of Section 37 lays down the power of the State Government where it feels the urgency for carrying out any such modification. In that case the State Government may publish the notice in the Official Gazette, and follow the similar procedure, but subsequently it has to place the proposal before the general body of the Planning Authority for its say, and thereafter only it may sanction the modification after consulting the Director of Town Planning in a similar manner. This shows that in the event of a minor modification the general body of the Planning Authority has a say in the matter. The Government has to invite the objections and suggestions from the public at large by publishing the notification in the Official Gazette, plus it has to issue a specific notice to the persons affected by the proposed modification, and last but not the least it has to consult the Director of Town Planning before arriving at its decision. In the present case nothing of the kind has been done.
53. In the instant case the officers of the Urban Development Department as well as of the PMC took the stand (until it was possible), that the procedure under Section 37 will have to be followed. This was because what was contemplated was a modification of a proposal made in the Development Plan. A reservation for an amenity was sought to be shifted (which will in fact mean it was sought to be deleted) from the place where it was provided. If that was the official view of UDD and PMC, what was required was a compliance of the procedure under Section 37(1) and (2). Ultimately, since the direction was given by the State Government, (and if the State Government thought that there was an urgency), it was necessary for it to act under Section 37(1AA), and to publish a notice in the Official Gazette to invite objections and suggestions from the public at large, and also from the persons affected by the proposed modification. Thereafter the State Government was required to send the proposal to PMC for its say and then it had to consult the Director of Town Planning.
Modifications of a substantial nature
54. Where the modification is of a substantial nature, a different procedure is prescribed under Section 22A of the Act. This Section reads as follows:
22A. Modifications of a substantial nature
In Section 29 or 31, the expression "of a substantial nature" used in relation to the modifications made by the Planning Authority or the officer appointed by the State Government under Sub-section (4) of Section 21 (hereinafter referred to as" the said Officer") or the State Government, as the case maybe, in the Draft Development Plan means,--
(a) reduction of more than fifty per cent., or increase by ten percent. in area of reservations provided for in Clauses (b) to (i)of Section 22, in each planning unit or sector of a draft Development Plan, in sites admeasuring more than 0.4 hectare in the Municipal Corporation area and 'A' Class Municipal area and 1.00 hectare in 'B' Class and 'C' Class Municipal areas;
(b) all changes which result in the aggregate to a reduction of any public amenity by more than ten per cent of the area provided in the planning unit or sector in a draft Development Plan prepared and published under Section 26 or published with modification under Section 29 or 31, as the case may be;
(c) reduction in an area of an actually existing site reserved for a public amenity except for marginal area up to two hundred square meters required for essential public amenity or utility services;
(d) change in the proposal of allocating the use of certain lands from one zone to any other zone provided by Clause (a) of Section 22 which results in increasing the area in that other zone by ten per cent. in the same planning unit or sector in a draft Development Plan prepared and published under section 26 or published with modification under Section 29 or 31, as the case may be;
(e) any new reservation made in a draft Development Plan which is not earlier published under Section 26, 29 or 31, as the case may be;
(f) alternation in the Floor Space Index beyond ten per cent. of the Floor Space Index prescribed in the Development Control Regulations prepared and published under Section 26 or published with modification under Section 29 or 31, as the case may be.
Additional requirement of notice in local newspapers before effecting modifications of substantial nature:
55. The modification under Section 22A requires following of the procedure under Section 29 of the MR Transfer of Property Act. It lays down that apart from a notice in the official gazette, a notice will have to be published in the local newspapers for the information at the public at large, so that they may make their suggestions or file objections thereto if they so deem it fit. Section 29 reads as follows:
29. Modification made after preparing and publishing notice of draft Development plan.
Where the modifications made by a Planning Authority or the said Officer in the draft Development plan are (of a substantial nature), the Planning Authority or as the case may be, the said Officer shall publish a notice in the Official Gazette and also in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions from any person with respect to the proposed modifications not later than sixty days from the date of such notice; and thereupon, the provisions of Section 28 shall apply in relation to such suggestions and objections as they apply to suggestions and objections dealt with under that section.
56. As seen from this Section 22A, it treats modifications of six types as substantial modifications. They are as follows:
(a) if a plot is admeasuring more than 0.4 hectare (i.e. 4000 sq. metres) in the Municipal Corporation area or an A class Municipal area a reduction of more than 50 per cent would be considered as a substantial modification. In B & C class Municipal Areas such a plot has to be of one hectare.
(b) secondly, under Sub-section (b) all changes which result in the aggregate to a reduction of any public amenity by more than ten per cent of the area provided in the planning unit are considered a substantial change.
(c) where there is an actually existing site reserved for a public amenity, except for marginal area up to two hundred square metres required for essential public amenities or utility services their reduction will be a substantial modification.
(d) shifting of the allocation of use of land from zone to zone which results in increasing the area in the other zone by ten per cent in the same planning unit will be a substantial modification.
(e) any new reservation made in a draft Development Plan which is not earlier published will be a substantial modification, and
(f) alternation in the Floor Space Index beyond ten per cent will be a substantial modification.
Importance given to the spaces reserved for public amenities
57. As we have noted, all such substantial modifications can be effected only after following the additional requirement laid down in Section 29 viz. a notice in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions within sixty days from the public at large with respect to the proposed modification. Sub-section (a) deals with reduction of more than fifty percent in area provided in Clauses (b) to (i) of Section 22 which Sub-sections are concerned with proposals for designation of land for public purposes such as schools, colleges, markets, and open spaces, playgrounds, transport and communications, water supply, drainage and sewerage and other public amenities. It can be seen that Sub-sections (b) and (c) of Section 22A give importance to retention of places reserved for public amenities. Sub-section (b) deals with a reduction of any public amenity by more than ten per cent of the area reserved in the planning unit. Sub-section (c) deals with any reduction in an actually existing site reserved for a public amenity (other than marginal area up to 200 sq. metres required for essential public amenities or utility services for e.g. road widening). Both are treated as substantial modifications. Section 2(2) of the MR Transfer of Property Act defines what is an "amenity". It is relevant to note that this definition of amenity includes primary and secondary schools and colleges and polytechnics. It reads as follows:
2 ((2). "amenity" means roads, streets, open spaces, parks recreational grounds, play grounds, sports complex, parade grounds, gardens, markets, parking lots, primary and secondary schools and colleges and polytechnics, clinics, dispensaries and hospitals, water supply, electricity supply, street lighting, sewerage, drainage, public works and includes other utilities, services and conveniences.)
58. In the present case we have a situation where the reservation for a Primary school on a plot of an area of 3450 sq. metres is deleted. Would it not amount to a substantial modification under Sub-section (b) of Section 22A since it results into deletion of a public amenity in the entire planning unit? Would it not mean that in view thereof it was necessary to follow the procedure required under Section 29 of the Act which provides for a public notice in the Official Gazette and also in the local newspapers inviting objections and suggestions? Would it not mean that thereafter it was necessary to follow the procedure to deal with the suggestions and objections laid down while finalizing the draft Development Plan under Section 28 of the Act? Whether the shifting of this reservation is covered under Section 37 or Section 22A is a moot point to consider. One thing is however very clear, that it could not be justified under D.C. Rule 13.5. If the statute provides for doing a particular act in a specified manner, it has got to be done in that manner alone, and not in any other manner.
Alleged Conflict between D.P. Plan and the erstwhile T.P. Scheme canvassed for the first time in the High Court -Can a provision in the erstwhile T.P. Scheme be relied upon in the face of a contrary reservation in the subsequent D.P. Plan?
59. In as much as the action of the State Government could not be defended under D.C. Rule 13.5, the Appellants came up with the submission for the first time in the High Court and then in this Court that under the erstwhile Town Planning Scheme, this F.P. No. 110 could be developed for residential purposes, and that purpose subsisted in spite of the subsequent reservation for a public purpose on that plot of land under the D.P. Plan.
60. It was pointed out that a Town Planning Scheme was framed under the then Bombay Town Planning Act of 1915 for Pune City to become effective from 1.3.1931. Regulation 14 of the Principal scheme framed under that Act provided for the areas included in the scheme which were intended mainly for residential purposes wherein this plot was included as original plot No. 230/C. It was subsequently allotted F.P. No. 110. There was no reservation on this plot for any public purpose. The 1915 Act was repealed and replaced by the Bombay Town Planning Act 1957 w.e.f. 1.4.1957 where under the concept of a Development Plan was introduced. However, by virtue of Section 90 of the 1954 Act the previous schemes were saved. The erstwhile Town Planning scheme as varied, was sanctioned by the State Government w.e.f. 15.8.1979, and there under the permissible user of F.P. No. 110 continued to be residential. In the meanwhile, in exercise of its power under the 1954 Act, the State Government sanctioned the Development Plan of Pune City w.e.f. 15.8.1966 where under F.P. No. 110-112 were reserved for a garden. The 1954 Act was repealed and replaced by the MR Transfer of Property Act 1966 w.e.f. 11.1.1967. By virtue of Section 165 of the MR Transfer of Property Act, however, the erstwhile Principal T.P. scheme (as varied), as well as the D.P. Plan were both saved. Subsequently, when the D.P. Plan of Pune City was revised in 1982 and finalized in 1987 under the provisions of the MR Transfer of Property Act, the reservation on the plot was initially proposed to be changed for a play-ground, but ultimately shifted for a primary school in the final 1987 DP Plan.
61. It is contended on behalf of the landowner and the developer that the permission for the user of the concerned plot of land for residential purposes under the T.P. Scheme effective from 15.8.1979 continued to survive by virtue of the saving clause under Section 165(2) of the MR Transfer of Property Act, and, therefore, the order passed by the Government on 3.9.1996 as well as the commencement certificates were valid even on that count. It is submitted that until the Town Planning scheme is varied under Section 39 read with 92 of MR Transfer of Property Act, the proposals in the Final Development Plan of 1987 cannot have any effect on the land covered by the erstwhile Town Planning scheme. The Development Plan and Town Planning scheme will both have their independent operation until the Town Planning scheme is varied to bring it in accord with the Development Plan. As noted earlier that right from 8.5.1979, when the landowner issued purchase notice, and led the State Government and PMC to acquire the plot of land, this plea was never raised (and the High Court would have been within its rights not to entertain this plea on the ground of acquiescing into the change of user under the D.P. Plan). The plea having been considered and rejected in the impugned judgment, is canvassed once again in this Court. To consider this plea, it becomes necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the Act.
Relevant provisions of the Act in the context of the D.P. Plan as against the erstwhile T.P. Scheme
62. The preamble of the MR Transfer of Property Act shows that this is an Act to make provisions for:
(1) planning the development and use of land in regions established for that purpose and for constitution of regional planning boards therefore,
(2) to make better provisions for the preparation of development plans with a view to ensuring that T.P. Schemes are made in the proper manner and their execution is made effective,
(3) to provide for the creation of new towns by means of development authorities,
(4) to make provisions for the compulsory acquisition of land required for public purposes in respect of the plans, and
(5) for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.
63. (i) Chapter I of the Act contains the Preliminary provisions. Chapter II of the Act is concerning the Regional Plans. Chapter III is about the Development Plan, and Chapter IV about Control of Development and Use of Land included in Development Plans. Chapter V is about the T.P. Schemes.
(ii) Section 3 of the Act permits the State Government to establish any area in the State to be a Region. A Regional Plan is supposed to be prepared for various subjects which are mentioned in Section 14 of the Act. The 'Development Plan' is defined under Section 2(9) of the Act as a plan for the development or re-development of the area within the jurisdiction of a planning authority. Section 2(19) defines the Planning Authority to mean a local authority, and it includes some other specified authorities also. There is no dispute that the development plan has to be prepared 'in accordance with the provisions of a Regional plan' which is what is specifically stated in Section 21(1) of the Act.
(iii) It is, however, disputed by the developer that the T.P. scheme which is normally supposed to be a detailed scheme for a smaller part of a Municipal Area has necessarily to be in consonance with the development plan. As against this submission we have the mandate of Section 39 of the Act, which reads as follows:
39. Variation of town planning scheme by Development Plan.
Where a final Development plan contains proposals which are in variation, or modification of those made in a town planning scheme which has been sanctioned by the State Government before the commencement of this Act, the Planning Authority shall vary such scheme suitably under Section 92 to the extent necessary by the proposals made in the final Development plan.
This Section states that the T.P. scheme shall be suitably varied to the extent necessary wherever the final development plan contains proposals which are in variation or modification of the proposals contained in the T.P. Scheme. In the instant case, we are concerned with the final development plan of 1987 which contains the reservation for a Primary School on F.P. No. 110 as against the plot being placed in a residential zone in the final T.P. scheme of 1979. It is submitted by the Appellant that the planning authority may take steps to vary the T.P. scheme suitably to bring it in consonance with the D.P plan, but until that is done, the provisions in the T.P. scheme will survive. The High Court has rejected this submission by holding that the D.P. plan overrides the T.P. Scheme.
64. As noted above, Section 39 lays down that the T.P. Scheme is to be varied suitably in accordance with the D.P. Plan under Section 92 of the Act. Section 92 appears in Chapter V which is on Town Planning schemes. The first section in this Chapter V is Section 59. reads as follows:
59. Preparation and contents of Town Planning Scheme
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being in force
(a) a Planning Authority may for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development Plan, prepare one or more town planning schemes for the area within its jurisdiction, or any part thereof;
(b) a town planning scheme may make provision for any of the following matters, that is to say
(i) any of the matters specified in Section 22;
(ii) the laying out or re-laying out of land, either vacant or already built upon, including areas of comprehensive development;
(iii) the suspension, as far as may be necessary for the proper carrying out of the scheme, of any rule, by-law, Regulation, notification or order made or issued under any law for the time being in force which the Legislature of the State is competent to make;
(iv) such other matter not inconsistent with the object of this Act, as may be directed by the State Government.
(2) In making provisions in a draft town planning scheme for any of the matter referred to in Clause (b) of Sub-section (1), it shall be lawful for a Planning Authority with the approval of the Director of Town Planning and subject to the provisions of Section 68 to provide for suitable amendment of the Development plan.
As can be seen, Section 59 states two things: firstly the opening part of sub Section 1 of Section 59 states that the T.P. scheme is to be prepared "subject to the provisions of this Act". Thereafter, Sub-Section 1(a) of this section specifically states that the planning authority is to prepare one or more T.P. schemes for the area within its jurisdiction "for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development Plan". Thus, Section 39 read with Section 59 do indicate the approach of legislature, namely, superiority of the D.P. plan over the T.P. scheme.
65. The learned senior counsel for the developer, Shri Naphade relied on the provisions contained in Section 59(1)(b)(i), and 59(2) of the Act in support of his arguments. Section 59(1)(b)(i) provides that a town planning scheme may make provision amongst others for any of the matters specified in Section 22 of the Act. Section 22 lays down as to what ought to be the contents of a Development Plan. Section 59(2) states that in making the draft T.P. scheme for any of the matters referred to in Sub-Section 1(b), it shall be lawful for a planning authority to provide for suitable amendments of the Development Plan. It is, therefore, submitted that there is no primacy between the Development Plan and the T.P. scheme. It is contended that if the purpose of the T.P. Scheme is only to implement the Development Plan, it will militate against the plain reading of Section 51(2) and 59(1)(b) and that, in such a case, Section 59(1)(b) will become otiose. Shri Naphade, therefore, submitted that the D.P. Plan and the T.P. Scheme both are of equal strength.
66. While examining this submission, we must note that Section 39 requires the T.P. scheme to be varied to the extent necessary in accordance with the final Development Plan. The provision in Section 59(1)(b)(i) is infact made to see to it that there is no conflict between the T.P. scheme and the Development Plan. Otherwise, the question will arise as to what meaning will be given to Section 59(1)(a) which specifically states that the T.P. scheme is to be prepared for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development Plan. Merely because Section 59(1)(b) provides that the T.P. scheme may make provision for any of the matters specified in Section 22, the T.P. scheme cannot be placed on the same pedestal as a Development Plan. Section 59(2) is only an enabling provision. It may happen that in a given situation a suitable amendment of the Development Plan may as well become necessary while seeing to it that the T.P. scheme is in consonance with the Development Plan. Section 59(2) will only mean that the legislature has given an elbow room to the planning authority to amend the Development Plan if that is so necessary, so that there is no conflict between the T.P. Scheme and the D.P. Plan. In fact what is indicated by stating that "it shall be lawful to carry out, such an amendment" is that normally such a reverse action is not expected, but in a given case if it becomes so necessary, it will not be unlawful. Use of this phrase in fact shows the superiority of the D.P. Plan over the T.P. scheme. Besides, the phrase put into service in this Sub-section is only 'to provide for a suitable amendment'. This enabling provision for an appropriate amendment in the D.P. plan cannot therefore, be raised to the level of the provision contained in Section 39 which mandates that the planning authority shall vary the T.P. scheme if the final D.P. Plan is in variation with the T.P. Scheme sanctioned before the commencement of the MR Transfer of Property Act. It also indicates that subsequent to the commencement of the Act, a T.P. Scheme will have to be inconsonance with the D.P. Plan. Similarly, Section 59(1)(b)(i) cannot take away the force of the provision contained in Section 59(1)(a) of the Act. As noted above, Section 39 specifically directs that the planning authority shall vary the T.P. scheme to the extent necessary by the proposal made in the final Development Plan, and Section 59(1)(a) gives the purpose of the T.P. scheme, viz. that it is for implementing the proposals contained in the final Development Plan. Under Section 31(6) of the act, a Development plan which has came into operation is binding on the planning authority. The Planning Authority cannot act contrary to D.P. plan and grant Development permission to defeat the provision of the D.P. plan. Besides, it cannot be ignored that a duty is cast on every planning authority specifically under Section 42 of the Act to take steps as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the plan referred in Chapter III of the Act, namely the Development Plan. Section 46 of the Act also lays down specifically that the planning authority in considering an application for permission for development shall have "due regard" to the provisions of any draft or any final plan or proposal submitted or sanctioned under the Act. It indicates that the moment a Draft Plan is proposed, a permission for a contrary development can no more be granted, since it will lead to a situation of conflict. Section 52 of the Act in fact provides for penalty for unauthorised development or for use otherwise then in conformity with the development plan. Thus, when it comes to the development in the area of a local authority, a conjoint reading of the relevant sections makes the primacy of the Development Plan sufficiently clear.
67. Much emphasis was laid on Section 69(6) which reads as follows:
(6) The provisions of Chapter IV shall, mutatis mutandis, apply in relation to the development and use of land included in a town planning scheme in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Chapter.
It was, therefore, submitted that thus the provisions of Chapter IV which are about the Control of Development and use of land included in the Development Plan, are mutatis mutandis applicable to the development and the use of land included in the T.P. scheme, and therefore the D.P. plan and T.P. scheme are on par.
68. Now, it is material to note that Sub-sections (1) to (5) of Section 69 operate when the draft T.P. scheme is under preparation. Sub-section (6) will have to be read on that background because this Sub-section itself states that provisions of Chapter IV will apply in relation to the development of the land included in a T.P. scheme "in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provision of this Chapter", i.e. Chapter V on Town Planning Schemes wherein Section 69 is placed. Chapter IV is on control of Development and use of land included in Development Plans. and as noted above, Section 59(1)(a) which is the first section of Chapter V clearly contains the direction that the T.P. scheme is to be prepared for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development Plan. Therefore, merely because by incorporating the provisions of Chapter IV those provisions are made applicable to T.P. schemes, the mandate of Section 59(1)(a) cannot be lost sight of.
69. It is then submitted by the Appellant that the Development Plan and the T.P. scheme operate independent of each other, and, until the State Government exercises its power of eminent domain under the Development Plan, and acquire the land, the landowner can develop his property as per the user permitted under the T.P. scheme. In view of the scheme of the relevant sections and particularly Section 46 which we have noted above, this submission cannot be accepted. It will mean permitting a development contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan, knowing fully well that the user under the T.P. scheme is at variance with the Development Plan. Any such interpretation will make provisions of Section 39, 42, 46 and 52 meaningless.
70. There is one more aspect of the matter. Section 43 of the Act lays down that after the date on which the declaration of intention to prepare a Development Plan is published, no person shall carry out any development on land without the permission of the Planning Authority. The principal part of this section reads as follows:
43. Restrictions on development of land
After the date on which the declaration of intention to prepare a Development plan for any area is published in the Official Gazette (or after the date on which a notification specifying any undeveloped area as a notified area, or any area designated as a site for a new town, is published in Official Gazette) no person shall institute or change the use of any land or carry out any development of land without the permission in writing of the Planning Authority.
71. This section will have to be read along with the requirement provided in Section 39. Section 39 provides for a T.P. Scheme sanctioned and subsisting prior to the Development Plan. The section mandates that such a prior scheme shall be varied to the extent necessary by the proposals made in the final Development Plan. Section 43 provides that once the declaration of intention to prepare a Development Plan is gazetted, no development contrary thereto can be permitted. As provided under Section 59(1)(a), the town planning scheme is to be prepared for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final Development Plan. Therefore, even if such a variation as directed under Section 39 does not take place, the land cannot be put to use in any way in contradiction with the provision in the D.P. Plan. In the instant case, we have a provision of the T.P. Scheme effective from 15.8.1979 as against the D.P. Plan containing a contrary provision which was notified on 18.9.1982. Shri Dholakia, learned senior counsel appearing for the State Government, therefore, rightly submitted that in view of Section 165 of the MR Transfer of Property Act, if the construction was completed, partly started or plans were submitted, or any such appropriate steps were taken prior to 18.9.1982, the same could have been permitted. Once the State Government published the draft Development Plan on 18.9.1982, providing for the reservation for a primary school, any construction contrary thereto could not be permitted. This can only be the interpretation of the provisions contained in Section 39 read with Section 43 and Section 165 of the MR Transfer of Property Act. For convenience, we may refer to Section 165(1) and (2), which read as follows:
165. Repeal and saving.
(1) The Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954 and Sections 219 to 226A and Clause (xxxvi) of Sub-section (2) of Section 274 of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, are hereby repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding the repeal of the provisions aforesaid, anything done or any action taken (including any declaration of intention to make a development plan or town planning scheme, any draft development plan or scheme published by a local authority, any application made to the State Government for the sanction of the draft development plan or scheme, any sanction given by the State Government to the draft development plan or scheme or any part thereof, any restriction imposed on any person against carrying out any development work in any building or in or over any land or upon an owner of land or building against the erection or re-erection of any building or works, any commencement certificate granted, any order or suspension of rule, bye-law, Regulation, notification or order made, any purchase notice served on a local authority and the interest of the owner compulsorily acquired or deemed to be acquired by it in pursuance of such purchase notice, any revision of development plan, any appointment made of Town Planning Officer, any proceeding pending before, and decisions of, a Town Planning Officer, any decisions of Board of Appeal, any final scheme forwarded to, or sanctioned, varied or withdrawn by the State Government, any delivery of possession enforced, any eviction summarily made, any notice served, any action taken to enforce a scheme, any costs of scheme calculated and any payments made to local authorities by owners of plots included in a scheme, any recoveries made or to be made or compensation awarded or to be awarded in respect of any plot, any rules or Regulations made under the repealed provisions shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act, and the provisions of this Act shall have effect in relation thereto.
72. The learned senior counsel Shri Virendra Tulzapurkar appearing for the tenants went to the extent of contending that by provisions in the T.P. Scheme are superior to those in the D.P. Plan. In support to his submission he relied upon the judgment of a Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in Gordhanbhai v. The Anand Municipality and Ors. reported in 16 (1975) GLR 558 which was under the Bombay Town Planning Act 1954 (the 1954 Act for short) as applicable to Gujarat. The Petitioner therein was aggrieved by the development permission granted by the Anand Municipality to the Respondents Nos. 4 to 12 to put up a structure on the plot adjoining to his plot. One of the objections raised by the Petitioner was that the disputed construction did not observe the margins prescribed in the Regulations framed under the Development Plan (comparable to the D.C. Regulations in the present case). The Respondents pointed out that the Regulations which were published and sanctioned by the State Government as a part of the T.P. scheme specifically provided that no margin should be imposed on the particular final plot of the Respondents Nos. 4 to 12. In view thereof, the Division Bench in para 6 of its judgment referred to Section 18(2)(k) of the 1954 Act which specifically provided that the Town Planning scheme may provide for the suspension, so far as may be necessary for the proper carrying out of the scheme of any rule, by-law, Regulation, notification or order made or issued under any Act of the State Legislature. Since that had been done, the permission for construction in the particular case could not be faulted. It was in this context that the Division Bench observed that the provisions of the scheme which are contrary to those Regulations shall prevail over the same. It is material to note that this provision in Section 18 (2)(k) of the 1954 Act is pari-materia to Section 59(1)(b)(iii) of the MR Transfer of Property Act. It is also material to note that like Section 59(1)(a) of the MR Transfer of Property Act, Section 18(1) of the 1954 Act provides as follows:
Making and contents of town planning scheme
18. Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being in force:
(1) a local authority for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the final development plan may make one or more town planning schemes for the area within its jurisdiction or any part thereof;
Section 18 of the 1954 Act as well as Section 59 of the MR Transfer of Property Act provide for suspension of the Regulations in a given case by making a specific provision in the T.P. scheme, which is basically with the object of implementing the proposals in the Final Development Plan. This judgment cannot therefore be relied upon to canvass a general proposition that the provisions in the Town Planning scheme are superior to the Development Plan.
The need for a holistic interpretation
73. The provision of a statute are required to be read together after noting the purpose of the Act, namely that there should be an orderly development in the region, local authority as well as in the town area. The MR Transfer of Property Act does not envisage a situation of conflict. Therefore one will have to iron out the edges to read those provisions of the Act which are slightly incongruous, so that all of them are read in consonance with the object of the Act, which is to bring about an orderly and planned development. The provision of Section 165 can not be read to mean a right to carry out a development contrary to the Development Plan, and in any case without a valid development permission particularly when the landowner had not taken any step in pursuance to the erstwhile T.P. scheme nor had objected to the changes brought in by the authorities by following the due process of law. The submissions of Shri Naphade and Tulzapurkar with respect to the alleged conflict between T.P. and D.P. can not, therefore, be accepted.
74. The observations of O. Chinnappa Reddy J. in para 33 of the judgment in Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless Corpn. reported in MANU/SC/0073/1987 : (AIR 1987 SC 1023 : 1987 (1) SCC 424) are instructive in this behalf -
33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place....
