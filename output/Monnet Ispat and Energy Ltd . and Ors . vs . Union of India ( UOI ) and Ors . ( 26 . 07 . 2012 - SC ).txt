Case Note:
R.M. Lodha, J. Mines and Minerals - Validity of Notification - Section 2 of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 - Government of India passed an order accepting request of State Government for withdrawal of mining proposals made in favour of Applicants - Division Bench of High Court dismissed Petitions filed by Appellants for grant of leases of iron-ore mines - Thereafter an interim order was passed in these Appeals that until further orders no fresh leases should be granted in respect of disputed mining area - Hence, this Appeal - Whether 1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by Government of erstwhile State of Bihar notifying for information of public that iron ore in subject area was reserved for exploitation in public sector were ultra vires and de hors Act, 1957 and 1960 Rules - Held, declaration made by Parliament in Section 2 and provisions that follow Section 2 of Act, 1957 have left untouched State's ownership of mines and minerals within its territory although Regulation of mines and development of minerals have been taken under control of Union - There was nothing in Act, 1957 to suggest even remotely, and there was no express provision at all - Rather scheme and provisions of Act 1957 themselves showed that Parliament itself contemplated State legislation for vesting of lands containing mineral deposits in State Government and that Parliament did not intend to trench upon powers of State Legislatures under Entry 18, List II - Hence declaration made by Parliament in Section 2 of Act, 1957 stated that it was expedient in public interest that Union should take under its control Regulation of mines and development of minerals to extent provided in Act itself - Hence Declaration made in Section 2 of Act, 1957 was not all comprehensive - Regulation of mines and development of minerals had been taken over under its control by Central Government to extent it was manifested in Act 1957 which did not contemplate acquisition of mines and minerals - Hence Reservation made by 1962 and 1969 Notifications was not in any manner contrary or inconsistent with 1957 Act - There was no lack of power in State in making such reservation - Appeal dismissed.

Constitution - Applicability - Whether statute was prospective or retrospective Court had to keep in mind presumption of prospectivity articulated in legal maxim nova constitution futur was for mam imponere debet non praeteritis, i.e., new law ought to regulate what was to follow, not past' - Held, lack of knowledge on part of State Government about reservation of areas for exploitation in public sector vide 1962 and 1969 Notifications did not affect in any manner legality and validity of these Notifications once it had been found that these Notifications had been issued by erstwhile State of Bihar in valid exercise of power which it had - Where Central Government had relied upon 2006 Notification while rejecting Appellant's Application for grant of mining lease, it necessarily implies that Central Government had approved reservation made by State Government in 2006 Notification otherwise it would not had acted on same - In any case Central Government had not disapproved reservation made by State Government in 2006 Notification - Hence 2006 Notification was prospective - Mere reference to 1962 and 1969 Notifications in 2006 Notification did not make 2006 Notification retrospective - Moreover in light of Section 85 of Bihar Reorganization Act read with Sections 84 and 86 thereof position that emerges was that existing law should have effect until it was altered, repealed and/or amended - Since new State of Jharkhand had not altered, repealed and/or amended 1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by erstwhile State of Bihar, it could not be said that 1962 and 1969 Notifications had lapsed - Moreover, in 2006 Notification, 1962 and 1969 Notifications and their effect had been mentioned and that also showed that 1962 and 1969 Notifications continued to operate - Expression, 'deposit was at all material times kept reserved vide Gazette Notification of State of Bihar' leaves no manner of doubt that 1962 and 1969 Notifications continued to operate and did not lapse - Appeal dismissed.

Constitution - Relief on basis of principles - Whether doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation help Appellants in obtaining reliefs claimed by them and whether actions of State Government and Central Government were liable to be set aside by applying these doctrines - Held, State Government could not be held to be bound by its commitments or assurances or representations made in MOU because by enforcement of such commitments or assurances or representations, object sought to be achieved by reservation of subject area was likely to be defeated and thereby affecting public interest - Hence overriding public interest also persuades in not invoking doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation - Hence act of State Government in withdrawing recommendations made by it to Central Government in factual and legal backdrop could not be said to be bad in law on touchstone of doctrine of promissory estoppel as well as legitimate expectation - Government of India upon examination of proposals rejected them on ground that subject area was under reservation and not available for exploitation by private parties - Hence if clauses in MOU were allowed to be carried out, it would tantamount to enforcement of promise, assurance or representation which was against law, public interest and public policy which could not be permitted - It was not that State Government could be compelled to carry out what it could not do in existing state of affairs in view of 1962 and 1969 Notifications - Hence on coming to know of 1962 and 1969 Notifications, State Government withdrew proposals which it made to Appellants and reiterated reservation by its Notification expressly in public interest and in larger interest of State - Act of State Government was neither unfair nor arbitrary nor it suffers from principles of natural justice - Thus for self-same reasons none of Appellants was entitled to any relief based on these doctrines their case was no better - Appeal dismissed.

Constitution - Applicability for Notification - Section 2 of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957- Whether doctrine of desuetude attracted in respect of 1962 and 1969 Notifications - Held, Notifications were of 1962 and 1969 and non-implementation of such Notifications for 30-35 years was not that long period which might satisfy first requirement of doctrine of desuetude, namely, that statute or legislation had not been in operation for very considerable period - Moreover State of Jharkhand came into existence on 15th November 2000 and it could hardly be said that 1962 and 1969 Notifications remained neglected by State Government for very considerable period - As matter of fact in 2006 State Government issued Notification mentioning therein about reservation made by 1962 and 1969 Notifications - Hence first ingredient necessary for invocation of doctrine of desuetude was not satisfied - Secondly and more importantly even if it was assumed in favour of Appellants that 1962 and 1969 Notifications remained in disuse for considerable period having not been implemented for more than 30-35 years, second necessary ingredient that practice contrary to above Notifications had been followed for considerable long period and such contrary practice had been firmly established is totally absent - As matter of fact except stray grant of mining lease for very small portion of reserved area to one or two parties there was nothing to suggest much less establish contrary usage or contrary practice that reservation made in two Notifications had been given complete go by - Once 1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by erstwhile State of Bihar and 2006 Notification issued by State of Jharkhand have been found to be valid and legal it would not invalidate action of State Government in recalling recommendation - Hence doctrine of desuetude was not attracted - Appeal dismissed.

Mines and Minerals - Validity of Notification - Section 2 and 5 of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 - Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 - Whether Notifications 1962 Notification and 1969 Notification issued by State of Bihar and 2006 Notification issued by State of Jharkhand were legal and valid - Held, authority to grant reconnaissance permit, prospecting license or mining lease on conditions which were mentioned in Section 5 of Act, 1957 was specifically retained with State Government - However with respect to minerals specified in First Schedule it was added that previous approval of Central Government was required - Provision did not in any way detract from ownership and authority of State Government to deal with mines situated within its territory - Only restriction was with respect to minerals in First Schedule which were specified minerals - If there was declaration by Parliament to extent of that declaration Regulation of mines and minerals development would be outside scope of State Legislation as provided under Entry No. 54 of Centre List - For invoking principle of promissory estoppel there had to be promise and on that basis party concerned must have acted to its prejudice - It was only proposal and it was very much made clear that it was to be approved by Central Government, prior whereto it could not be construed as containing promise - Besides equity could not be used against statutory provision or notification - Mines and minerals were part of wealth of nation they constitute material resources of community - Public interest was very much writ large in provisions of Act, 1957 and in declaration Under Section 2 of Act, 1957 thereof - Ownership of mines vests in State of Jharkhand in view of declaration under provisions of Act, 1950 which act was protected by placing it in Ninth Schedule added by First Amendment to Constitution - There was no error in letter of withdrawal issued by State of Jharkhand, and letter of rejection issued by Union of India - Thus all that State Government had done was to act in furtherance of policy of statute and it could not be faulted for same - Thus interim orders passed would stand vacated - Appeal dismissed.
Ratio Decidendi:
"State Government shall have inherent right to reserve any particular area for exploitation in public sector, and shall have power not grant or refuse of leases in reserving areas for public sector undertakings on basis of notifications."

Introduction
1. This group of six appeals occupied considerable judicial time. These matters were heard on ten days between November 2, 2011 and November 29, 2011. Although the facts differ from one another in some respects but since fundamental issues appeared to be common and all these matters arise from a common judgment dated April 4, 2007 passed by the Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court at Ranchi, we have heard all these matters together which are being disposed of by this common judgment.
Prayers
2. The prayers in the writ petitions filed by the Appellants before the High Court also differ. However, principally the reliefs prayed for by the Appellants in their writ petitions were for quashing (i) the decision of the Department of Mines and Geology, Government of Jharkhand contained in the letter dated September 13, 2005 whereby the State Government sought to withdraw the recommendation for grant of mining lease made in favour of the Appellants in the subject iron ore bearing areas in Mauza Ghatkuri, West Singhbhum District, Jharkhand (ii) the order of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India whereunder the said Ministry returned the recommendation made by Government of Jharkhand in favour of each of the Appellants (iii) for declaring the Notifications dated December 21, 1962 and February 28, 1969 issued by the Government of Bihar and the Notification dated October 27, 2006 issued by the Government of Jharkhand null and void and (iv) directing the Respondents to proceed under Rule 59(2) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for short, '1960 Rules') for grant of mining lease to each of the Appellants in the iron ore bearing areas in Ghatkuri as applied.
Bihar Land Reforms Act
3. Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (for short, '1950 Bihar Act') came to be enacted by the Bihar Legislature to provide for the transference to the State of the interest of proprietors and tenure holders in land of the mortgagees and lessees of such interest including interest in mines and minerals and other matters connected therewith. It came into force on September 25, 1950. Chapter II of the 1950 Bihar Act deals with vesting of an estate or tenure in the State and its consequences. The State Government has been empowered Under Section 3 to declare that the estates or tenures of a proprietor or tenure holder, as may be specified in the notification/s from time to time, to become vested in the State. Section 4 provides for consequences of vesting of an estate or tenure in the State. Section 4 has undergone amendments on few occasions. To the extent it is relevant, Section 4 of the 1950 Bihar Act reads as follows:
4. Consequences of the vesting of an estate or tenure in the State.-Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or any contract and notwithstanding any non-compliance or irregular compliance of the provisions...on the publication of the notification under Sub-section (1), of Section 3 or Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) of Section 3A, the following consequences shall ensue and shall be deemed always to have ensued, namely;
(a) Suchestate or tenure including the interests of the proprietor or tenure-holder in any building or part of a building comprised in such estate or tenure ... as also his interest in all sub soil including any rights in mines and minerals whether discovered or undiscovered or whether been worked or not, inclusive of such rights of a lessee of mines and minerals, comprised in such estate are tenure (other than the interests of raiyats or under -raiyats) shall, with effect from the date of vesting, vest absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances and such proprietor or tenure-holder shall cease to have any interest in such estate or other than the interests expressly saved by or under the provisions of this Act.
4. The brief facts relating to each of these appeals may be noticed now.
Factual features
Civil Appeal No. 3285 of 2009, Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors.
5. The Appellant company, referred to as Monnet, is registered under the Companies Act, 1956. Monnet is engaged in the business of mining, production of steel, ferro-alloys and power. Monnet decided to set up an integrated steel plant in Hazaribagh District with a proposed investment of Rs. 1400 crores. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was entered into between Monnet and the State Government on February 5, 2003. The main raw material for the integrated steel plant is iron ore. On January 29, 2004, Monnet made an application to State of Jharkhand, referred to as State Government, for mining lease of iron ore over an area of 3566.54 hectares in Mauza Ghatkuri for the purpose of the proposed steel plant.
5.1. It is the case of Monnet that after consideration of the application and following the necessary procedure contemplated under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1957 Act') and the 1960 Rules, the State Government in August, 2004 recommended Monnet's application to the Government of India for grant of mining lease of iron ore over an area of 705 hectares in Mauza Ghatkuri Under Section 5(1) and Section 11(5) of the 1957 Act. The recommendation was made after the State Government was satisfied that the said mining block was suitable for exploitation and met the requirement of Monnet. The recommendation was also made on priority basis as Monnet fulfilled the essential objectives of the industrial policy of the State with commitment for investment and growth of employment and social sector under its aegis.
5.2. The Ministry of Mines, Government of India, on receipt of the recommendation of the State Government, sought for certain clarifications from the State Government vide their communication dated September 6, 2004. The State Government is said to have responded to the said communication and clarified the position in their reply of November 17, 2004. The State Government reiterated the recommendation in favour of Monnet setting out the comparative merit of all such proposals.
5.3. On November 17, 2004, the District Mining Officer, Chaibasa informed the Secretary, Department of Mines and Geology, Government of Jharkhand that certain portions of Mauza Ghatkuri and the adjoining areas were reserved for public sector exploitation under the two Notifications issued by the Government of Bihar on December 21, 1962 and February 28, 1969. He further suggested that approval of the Central Government under Rule 59(2) of the 1960 Rules should be obtained by the State Government for grant of leases in this area to avoid complications.
5.4. The Central Government vide its letter dated June 15, 2005 informed that a joint meeting of officers of Ministry of Mines, Government of India and concerned officers of the State Government be held to clarify certain issues in connection with the Ghatkuri Reserve Forest.
5.5. On June 29, 2005, a joint meeting of the officials of the Central Government and State Government on the issues relating to proposals for grant of mining leases in Ghatkuri was held wherein the Secretary of the State Government is stated to have requested the Central Government to hold on the processing of the pending applications.
5.6. On September 13, 2005, the State Government requested the Central Government to return the proposals of mining lease of nine out of ten applicants, including Monnet.
5.7. On September 14, 2005, a joint meeting of the officials of the State Government and the Central Government took place. In that meeting also the officials of the State Government informed the Central Government that it has decided to withdraw nine pending mining lease proposals, including that of Monnet.
5.8. Monnet has averred that compartment No. 5 which was recommended for allocation to it was not at all affected by reservation. Block No. D (500 acres) which is overlapping with compartment No. 5 (recommended in favour of Monnet) was earlier lease area of M/s. Rungta Sons Pvt. Ltd. (for short, 'Rungta'). The said lease was granted to Rungta for twenty years upto September 3, 1995. Monnet claims that application for renewal was not submitted by Rungta one year prior to expiry of their lease and their lease automatically expired on September 3, 1995. Moreover, only 102.25 hectares area has been overlapping with compartment No. 5 (out of the 705 hectares recommended by the State Government for Monnet). Monnet has thus, set up the case that the area recommended by the State Government for grant of mining lease to it was not under any previous reservation for any public sector undertaking.
5.9. On March 6, 2006, the Government of India passed an order accepting the request of the State Government dated September 13, 2005 for withdrawal of the mining proposals made in favour of applicants, including Monnet.

The main issue
13. The foremost point that arises for consideration is whether the Notifications dated December 21, 1962 (to be referred as 1962 Notification) and February 28, 1969 (to be referred as 1969 Notification) issued by the State of Bihar and the Notification dated October 27, 2006 (referred to as 2006 Notification) issued by the State of Jharkhand are legal and valid. It is a little complex point, because it involves threading one's way through statutory provisions contained in 1957 Act and 1960 Rules. I shall set them out to the extent these are relevant after noticing the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties.
14. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior Counsel for Monnet, did initially raise the plea that 1962 and 1969 Notifications were never published in the official gazette but on production of gazette copies of these Notifications by learned senior Counsel for the State of Jharkhand, the plea with regard to the non-publication of these Notifications was not carried further.

Contentions
18. Learned senior Counsel for the Appellants highlighted different aspects while setting up challenge to the 1962, 1969 and 2006 Notifications. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior Counsel for Monnet focussed more on factual aspects peculiar to Monnet. I shall refer to the factual aspects highlighted by Mr. Ranjit Kumar in the later part of the judgment. While assailing validity of 1962, 1969 and 2006 Notifications, he referred to the provisions of 1957 Act and submitted that reservation was part of a regulatory regime. According to him, 'Regulation of mines' means regulatory regime which has been taken over by the Central Government and that would include 'reservation'. He would submit that a proprietary right should not be mixed up with inherent right insofar as mining is concerned.
19. Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior Counsel for Ispat argued that the 2006 Notification was bad in law for (1) 1962 and 1969 Notifications were not valid and as such could not be relied upon to give sanctity to the 2006 Notification; (2) 2006 Notification attempted to reserve the area for exploitation by public sector undertaking or joint ventures when Section 17A of the 1957 Act only allows the State Government to reserve area for public sector undertakings and non-joint ventures; Section 17A does not envisage a private participation and (3) Under Section 17A of the 1957 Act, the prior approval of the Central Government was needed before the State could reserve any area for public sector undertakings and no such prior approval was taken.
20. Mr. C.A. Sundaram would submit that 1962 and 1969 Notifications were invalid since Section 18 of the 1957 Act vests power of conservation and systematic development of minerals with Central Government; there was statutory prohibition on the State Government to make law with regard to conservation and development of minerals in India. Rule 59 as it stood in 1962 and 1969 envisaged a situation where reservation could be made only for a temporary purpose or for an emergency and it did not empower the State to reserve the area for public sector undertaking. Learned senior Counsel submitted that power of reservation by the State Government for public sector undertakings was introduced for the first time by way of amendment to Rule 58 of the 1960 Rules in 1980 and as such no power existed prior to 1980 for the State Government to reserve areas for public sector undertakings. Alternatively, he submitted that even if 1962 and 1969 Notifications were held to be validly issued with proper authority of law at that point of time, the fact that Rule 58 was omitted in 1988 without any saving clause necessarily meant that 1962 and 1969 Notifications were no longer valid and could not be relied upon. He argued that current power of reservation contained in Section 17A of the 1957 Act is consistent with the erstwhile Rules 58/59 since Section 17A expressly requires the prior approval of the Central Government before State Government issues any notification for reservation of mining area for public sector undertakings.
21. The decisions of this Court in Hingir-Rampur Coal Company Limited and Ors. v. State of Orissa and Ors. MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459; State of Orissa and Anr. v. M/s M.A. Tulloch and Company MANU/SC/0021/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 1284; Baijnath Kadio v. State of Bihar and Ors. MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838; Amritlal Nathubhai Shah and Ors. v. Union Government of India and Anr. MANU/SC/0037/1976 : 1976 (4) SCC 108; India Cement Limited and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. MANU/SC/0226/1989 : 1990 (1) SCC 12; Orissa Cement Limited v. State of Orissa and Ors. 1991 Suppl. (1) SCC 430 and Maya Mathew v. State of Kerala and Ors. MANU/SC/0172/2010 : 2010 (4) SCC 498 were cited. Mr. C.A. Sundaram sought to distinguish Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd and submitted that in any case Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd was not a good law.
22. Mr. L. Nageswara Rao and Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior Counsel, appeared for Adhunik and argued that 1962 and 1969 Notifications were issued in contravention of law without the statutory prior approval of the Central Government under the 1957 Act. The 2006 Notification was only a reiteration of what was contained in the 1962 and 1969 Notifications. 2006 Notification is bad in law and ultra vires of Section 17A of the 1957 Act. It was submitted that the State Government never adopted the 1962 and 1969 Notifications and, therefore, these Notifications had lapsed even if passed with due authority of law. In this regard, the judgment in Pratik Sarkar, M.B. Suresh and Jitendra Laxman Thorve v. State of Jharkhand 2008 (56) 1 BLJR 660 was relied upon.
23. Mr. G.C. Bharuka, learned senior Counsel appeared for Abhijeet and submitted that till July 1963, the State Government had no power to reserve any mineral bearing land for grant of prospecting licence or mining lease to any given class of persons, including the public sector undertakings. It was submitted that on declaration Under Section 2 of the 1957 Act, the State Legislature was completely denuded of its power to legislate in respect of mines and minerals and consequently, the State Government had ceased to have any Executive power in respect of mines and minerals though it remained to be owner of the land and the minerals. In this regard, learned senior Counsel referred to decisions of this Court in M.A. Tulloch and Company MANU/SC/0021/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 1284; Baijnath Kadio MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838 and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Ors. 1990 (4) SCC 557. Mr. Bharuka also distinguished the decision of this Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shah MANU/SC/0037/1976 : 1976 (4) SCC 108 and submitted that though there was no specific statutory provision of vesting power with the State Government for reservation, but in that case the Court inferred such power from Rule 59 of the 1960 Rules. Rule 59, as originally framed in 1960, permitted reservation only for "any purpose other than prospecting or mining for minerals". Vide Notification dated July 9, 1963, the words "other than prospecting or mining for minerals" were deleted and, therefore, on December 21, 1962 when the Notification was issued by the State of Bihar reserving the lands in dispute for exploitation by public sector, it had no power to do so. Learned senior Counsel submitted that Amritlal Nathubhai Shah dealt with situation post 1963 amendment in Rule 59 and not pre-amendment.
24. Learned senior Counsel submitted that the "reservation of mineral bearing areas for exploitation by public sector" is covered under the declaration made by Parliament Under Section 2 of the 1957 Act in view of List I, Entry 54 of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The topic relating to "reservation" is covered within the field of "regulating the grant of mining lease" and that would include the power to grant or not to grant mining lease to a particular person. The "reservation" would come within the scope of "regulating the grant of mining lease" for which the Central Government is given the power to make rules. The Central Government, as a delegate of the Parliament, can frame rules with respect to "regulating the grant of mining lease". By placing reliance upon Baijnath Kadio MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838 and Bharat Coking Coal 1990 (4) SCC 557, it was submitted that whether the rules are made or not, the topic is covered by Parliamentary Legislation and to that extent the power of State Legislature ceased to exist. With reference to Rule 58, it was submitted that by amendment brought in 1960 Rules in 1980, the State Governments became competent to reserve areas for exploitation by Government or a Corporation established by any Central, State or Provincial Act or a government company within the meaning of Section 617 of the Companies Act. The Central Government could frame the above rule under its rule-making power in Section 13 of 1957 Act only because the topic of reservation was covered within the declaration Under Section 2 of the 1957 Act and was well within the scope of "to the extent hereinafter provided".
25. In respect of validity of Notification dated October 27, 2006 issued by the State Government, it was submitted that 2006 Notification seeks to reserve the area for "joint venture" but that is not permissible Under Section 17A of the 1957 Act. Section 17A(2) mandates that the area should be reserved "with the approval of the Central Government" and there was no approval granted to the 2006 Notification. Moreover, 2006 Notification by its own words, is nothing but merely an informatory Notification having no legal significance or consequence.
26. Dr. Rajiv Dhavan, learned senior Counsel made his submissions on behalf of Jharkhand Ispat. He vehemently contended that the 1962 Notification was wholly illegal and invalid as it was totally contrary to Rule 59 of 1960 Rules as it then stood which specifically allowed reservation for any purpose other than prospecting or mining for minerals. In this connection, he relied upon a decision of this Court in Janak Lal v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. MANU/SC/0237/1989 : 1989 (4) SCC 121.
27. Learned senior Counsel referred to changes that occurred in 1957 Act and 1960 Rules with effect from February 10, 1987. He submitted that by virtue of Section 17A(3) which was brought in 1987 the State Governments acquired power of reservation for specific areas with the approval of the Central Government. From April 13, 1988 under Rule 59(2) of the 1960 Rules, the Central Government could relax the provisions of Sub-rule (1) in any special case. According to learned senior Counsel, reservation under 1969 Notification was technically permissible because Rule 59 was amended in 1963 by removing 'no mining restriction' but reservations after 1980 and especially 1988 could be made only under a new statutory regime.
28. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan also based his argument on the doctrine of federalism and submitted that the State of Bihar had no legal power to reserve the area de hors the 1957 Act. He submitted that 1957 Act was wholly occupied field on the subject of mines and minerals and that ousts the state legislative and congruent executive power wholly and squarely. In support of his submissions, he referred to the decisions of this Court in Hingir-Rampur Coal Company MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459, Baijnath Kadio MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838, State of Assam and Ors. v. Om Prakash Mehta and Ors. MANU/SC/0535/1972 : 1973 (1) SCC 584, State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Limited and Ors. MANU/SC/0038/2004 : 2004 (10) SCC 201 and Sandur Manganese and Iron Ors. Limited v. State of Karnataka and Ors. MANU/SC/0695/2010 : 2010 (13) SCC 1.
29. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan submitted that merely because State happens to be the owner of the land including mines, it does not give it power to mine or reserve outside the regime of 1957 Act and 1960 Rules. He submitted that Amritlal Nathubhai Shah's cased must be confined to its own facts. The decision in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd was founded on the specific finding that the State's action was consistent with Rule 59; it does not test the proposition of a conflict between the State's power over land and the Union's take over of the field of mines and minerals. Moreover, learned senior Counsel would submit that Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd failed to take note of earlier Constitution Bench decisions of this Court. Learned senior Counsel also submitted that the decision of this Court in Kesoraml has no application as the said decision deals with the State's power to tax.
30. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior Counsel for Prakash submitted that prior to November 16, 1980, there was no power with the State Governments to reserve any area for exploitation by the Government or a Corporation established by Central or State Act or a government company. It was only by way of amendment to Rule 58 on November 16, 1980 that for the first time the State Governments were conferred power to reserve any area for exploitation by the Government or a Corporation established by the Central, State or Provincial Act or a government company. According to him, the question for consideration in the present context should be whether prior to 1980, the State had power either to 'prohibit mining' or to 'reserve mining for public sector undertaking'. In this regard, he referred to decisions of this Court in Baijnath Kadio MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838, D.K. Trivedi and Sons and Ors. v. State of Gujarat and Ors. 1986 (Suppl.) SCC 20, State of Tamil Nadu v. Hind Stone and Ors. MANU/SC/0394/1981 : 1981 (2) SCC 205 and Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Limited v. Union of India and Ors. 1992 Supp (1) SCC 91. He submitted that in view of the above, 1962 Notification reserving iron ore area in the State of Bihar for exploitation of mineral in public sector was clearly beyond the power of the State. He submitted that the State did not have any inherent power to reserve any area for mining in view of the declaration made by Parliament Under Section 2 of the 1957 Act and in any case Rule 59 of the 1960 Rules, as it originally stood, specifically excluded reservation with regard to prospecting or mining of mineral prior to June 9, 1963.
31. As regards 2006 Notification, Mr. Mehta submitted that the said Notification firstly, was not a fresh exercise of reservation as it refers to reservation already made by 1962 and 1969 Notifications. Secondly, even if it is assumed that 2006 Notification is a fresh order for reservation in exercise of the power Under Section 17A(2) of the 1957 Act, yet the said Notification suffers from diverse infirmities, namely, (a) there is no approval by the Central Government and (b) being an exercise of subordinate legislation, it cannot be given retrospective effect. Reliance was placed by the learned senior Counsel on Hukam Chand etc. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0506/1972 : 1972 (2) SCC 601.
Central Government's Stand
32. Mr. Ashok Bhan, learned senior Counsel for the Union of India referred to Entry 54 of the Union List, Entry 23 of the State List, Article 246 of the Constitution, various Sections of 1957 Act and Rules of 1960 Rules and submitted that Central Government having taken power on to itself by enacting 1957 Act, the legislative field relating to 'minerals - Regulation and development' is occupied and the Central Government was the sole regulator. Mr. Ashok Bhan submitted that under the scheme of law, the State Government was denuded of its power other than what flows from the 1957 Act. In matters of Regulation of mines and development of minerals, according to Mr. Ashok Bhan, public interest is paramount.
Reply on behalf of the State Government
33. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior Counsel for the State of Jharkhand, in reply, strongly contested the contentions of learned senior Counsel appearing for the Appellants. He vehemently contended that the State Government had the inherent power to reserve any area for exploitation as the owner of the land and minerals vested in it. He submitted that the Bihar Legislature enacted 1950 Bihar Act which received the assent of the President and came into force on September 25, 1950. Section 4(a) thereof vested all pre-existing estates or tenures including rights in mines and minerals absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances. 1950 Bihar Act has been held to be constitutionally valid by a decision of this Court in The State of Bihar v. Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and Ors. MANU/SC/0019/1952 : 1952 SCR 889. In any event, Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior Counsel submitted that 1950 Bihar Act has been put in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution and was, therefore, beyond the pale of challenge. Moreover, the sovereign executive power of the State Government under Article 298 of the Constitution to carry on any trade or business and to acquire, hold and dispose of property for any purpose comprehends and includes the power to reserve land for exploitation of its minerals in the public sector. He heavily relied upon the decisions of this Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shah MANU/SC/0037/1976 : 1976 (4) SCC 108, Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Limited 1992 Supp (1) SCC 91 and Bhupatrai Maganlal Joshi and Ors. v. Union of India and Anr. : 2001 (10) SCC 476
34. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, leaned senior Counsel submitted that the source of power for issuance of 1962, 1969 and 2006 Notifications is clearly traceable to the relevant statutory provisions. Learned senior Counsel would submit that source of 1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by the then State of Bihar was traceable to Rule 59 of 1960 Rules as it then stood followed by amendment in that rule on July 9, 1963, while 2006 Notification is traceable to Section 17A(2) of 1957 Act read with Rule 59(1)(e) as inserted with effect from April 13, 1988.
35. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior Counsel submitted that even otherwise there was no conflict or encroachment by the State of any occupied field. The State has neither been divested nor barred nor prohibited by 1957 Act or 1960 Rules. Instead, the unfettered power of reservation vested with the State alone under Rule 59 of 1960 Rules from 1962 to 1987 and thereafter Under Section 17A(2). According to him, after 1987 there is a concurrent power of reservation both with State Governments as well as Central Government as provided in Section 17A of the 1957 Act and Rule 59(1)(e) of the 1960 Rules. He relied upon decisions of this Court in Lord Krishna Textile Mills v. Its Workmen MANU/SC/0216/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 860, Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Escorts Limited and Ors. MANU/SC/0015/1985 : 1986 (1) SCC 264, Municipal Corporation for City of Pune and Ors. v. Bharat Forge Company Limited and Ors. 1995 (3) SCC 434 and High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan v. P.P. Singh and Anr. MANU/SC/0050/2003 : 2003 (4) SCC 239.
36. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior Counsel referred to the provisions of the 1957 Act, particularly Sections 2, 4(3), 4A, 10(1), 13(2) (e), 16(1)(b), 17(1), 17A(1)(A), 18A(6), 21(5), 28 and 30 to show that Parliament itself contemplated state legislation for vesting of lands containing mineral deposits in the State Government and Parliament did not intend to trench upon powers of State legislatures under Entry 18 of List II. He relied upon the decisions of this Court in State of Haryana and Anr. v. Chanan Mal and Ors. MANU/SC/0073/1976 : 1977 (1) SCC 340, Ishwari Khetan Sugar Mills (P) Limited and Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/0069/1980 : 1980 (4) SCC 136 and Kesoram MANU/SC/0038/2004 : 2004 (10) SCC 201. He heavily relied upon the expression employed in Entry 54, 'to the extent to which such Regulation and development under the control of Union is declared by Parliament by law' and the expression 'to the extent hereinafter provided' in Section 2 of 1957 Act and submitted that what follows from this is that only when there is a bar or a prohibition in the law declared by the Parliament in the 1957 Act and/or the Rules made thereunder and if the State encroaches on the field covered/occupied then to that extent, the act or action of the State would be ultra vires. Thus, Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha would submit that the power or competence of the state legislatures to enact laws or of the State Government to issue notification remains unaffected if the field is neither occupied nor disclosed nor prohibited. In this regard, he referred to few decisions of this Court, namely, Hingir-Rampur Coal Company MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459, M.A. Tulloch and Co. MANU/SC/0021/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 1284, Baijnath Kadio MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838, India Cement Limited MANU/SC/0226/1989 : 1990 (1) SCC 12, Bharat Coking Coal 1990 (4) SCC 557, Orissa Cement Limited 1991 Suppl. (1)SCC 430 and Kesoram MANU/SC/0038/2004 : 2004 (10) SCC 201.
37. Learned senior Counsel would submit that the Central Government also upon examination of the applications made by the Appellants rejected the proposals on the ground of reservation made by the then State of Bihar under 1962 and 1969 Notifications and, thus, it can be inferred that these Notifications received post facto approval from the Central Government. In this regard, learned senior Counsel relied upon M/s Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Company Limited v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0336/1978 : 1979 (2) SCC 409, Amrit Banaspati Limited and Anr. v. State of Punjab and Anr. MANU/SC/0198/1992 : 1992 (2) SCC 411, State of Punjab v. Nestle India Ltd. and Anr. MANU/SC/0500/2004 : 2004 (6) SCC 465, M.P. Mathur and Ors. v. DTC and Ors. 2006 (13) SCC 706 and Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores Limited MANU/SC/0695/2010 : 2010 (13) SCC 1.
38. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior Counsel submitted that 1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by the then State of Bihar have been reiterated by the State Government on its formation by 2006 Notification. He referred to Section 85 of the Bihar Reorganization Act, 2000 that provides that the appropriate government may, before the expiration of two years adapt and/or modify the law and every such law shall have effect subject to the adaptations and modifications so made until altered, repealed or amended by a competent legislature. He, thus, submitted that by virtue of Section 85 of Bihar Reorganization Act, 2000 read with Sections 84 and 86 thereof, it is clear that the existing law shall have effect till it is altered, repealed and/or amended.
Interveners' view
39. Mr. Vikas Singh, Mr. Krishnan Venugopal and Mr. P.S. Narasimha, learned senior Counsel, appeared for interveners. While adopting the arguments advanced on behalf of State of Jharkhand, Mr. Vikas Singh submitted that reservation of minerals is inherent right vested in the State. Mr. Krishnan Venugopal, learned senior Counsel heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd and submitted that the said decision was binding and not per incuriam as contended on behalf of the Appellants. He submitted that many provisions in 1957 Act and 1960 Rules acknowledge that all minerals vest in the State and that power to reservation is contemplated by Rule 59 of 1960 Rules.
40. After this group of appeals was fully argued before us and the appeals were reserved for judgment, a Special Leave Petition, Geo-Minerals and Marketing (P) Ltd. v. State of Orissa and Ors., arising out of the judgment of Orissa High Court in W.A. (c) No. 6288/2006 came up for final disposal wherein one of the issues concerning reservation of mining area by the Government of Orissa for exploitation in public sector was found to be involved. We thought fit that learned senior Counsel and Counsel appearing in that matter were also heard so that we can have benefit of their view-point as well. Accordingly, we heard M/s. Harish Salve, K.K. Venugopal and R.K. Dwivedi, learned senior Counsel, on the common legal aspect.
41. I would have preferred not to burden this judgment with the text of Entry 54 of List I, Entry 23 of List II and the relevant provisions contained in 1957 Act and 1960 Rules but reproduction of some of the provisions is necessary for having the point under consideration in proper perspective.
Relevant Entries
42. Entry 54, List I, is as follows:
54. Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such Regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.
43. Entry 23, List II, is as under:
23. Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to Regulation and development under the control of the Union.
Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948
44. The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (for short, '1948 Act') was enacted to provide for the Regulation of mines and oilfields and for the development of the minerals under Entry 36 of the Government of India Act, 1935. It received the assent of the Governor General on September 8, 1948 and came into effect from that date. Under 1948 Act, the Central Government framed Mineral Concession Rules, 1949.
45. 1948 Act was repealed by 1957 Act. The introduction of 1957 Act reads as follows:
In the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution in Union List entry 54 provides for Regulation of mines and minerals development to the extent to which such Regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest. On account of this provision it became imperative to have a separate legislation. In order to provide for the Regulation of mines and the development of minerals, the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Bill was introduced in the Parliament.
Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 and the Amendments
46. 1957 Act came into effect on June 1, 1958. It has been amended from time to time.
47. Section 2 of the 1957 Act reads as follows:
S. 2. Declaration as to the expediency of Union control.- It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the Regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided.
48. Section 3(a),(c),(d),(e),(f), (g) and (h) defines 'minerals', 'mining lease', 'mining operations', 'minor minerals', 'prescribed' 'prospecting licence' and 'prospecting operations' in the 1957 Act as under:
3(a) "minerals" includes all minerals except mineral oils;
(c) "mining lease" means a lease granted for the purpose of undertaking mining operations, and includes a sub-lease granted for such purpose;
(d) "mining operations" means any operations undertaken for the purpose of winning any mineral;

Provided that nothing in this Sub-section shall affect any prospecting or mining operations undertaken in any area in accordance with the terms and conditions of a prospecting licence or mining lease granted before the commencement of this Act which is in force at such commencement.
(2) No prospecting licence or mining lease shall be granted otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder.
50. In 1986, 1987 and 1999, Section 4 of the 1957 Act came to be amended. After these amendments, Section 4 reads as under:

51. Section 5 of the 1957 Act, as originally enacted, provided that no prospecting licence or mining lease should be granted by a State Government to any person unless the conditions prescribed therein were satisfied. It mandated previous approval of the Central Government before grant of prospecting licence or mining lease by the State Government.
52. The original Section 5 came to be amended in 1986, 1994 and 1999. After these amendments, Section 5 now provides that a State Government shall not grant a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease to any person unless he satisfies the requisite conditions. The provision mandates that in respect of any mineral specified in the First Schedule, no reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease shall be granted except with the previous approval of the Central Government.
53. Section 6 of 1957 Act provides for maximum area for which a prospecting licence or mining lease may be granted. Section 7 makes provision for the periods for which prospecting licence may be granted or renewed and Section 8 provides for periods for which mining lease may be granted or renewed.
54. Section 10 of the 1957 Act provides that application for reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease in respect of any land in which the minerals vest in the Government shall be made to the State Government concerned. Inter alia, it empowers the concerned State Government to grant or refuse to grant the permit, licence or lease having regard to the provisions of 1957 Act or 1960 Rules.
55. The original Section 11 of the 1957 Act read as follows:
Section 11.(1) Where a prospecting licence has been granted in respect of any land, the licensee shall have a preferential right for obtaining a mining lease in respect of that land over any other person:
Provided that the State Government is satisfied that the licensee has not committed any breach of the terms and conditions of the prospecting licence and is otherwise a fit person for being granted the mining lease.
(2) Subject to the provisions of Sub-section (1), where two or more persons have applied for a prospecting licence or a mining lease in respect of the same land, the applicant whose application was received earlier shall have a preferential right for the grant of the licence or lease, as the case may be, over an applicant whose application was received later:
Provided that where any such applications are received on the same day, the State Government, after taking into consideration the mattes specified in Sub-section (3), may grant the prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, to such one of the applicants as it may deem fit.
(3) The matters referred to in Sub-section (2) are the following:
(a) any special knowledge of, or experience in, prospecting operations or mining operations, as the case may be, possessed by the applicant;
(b) the financial resources of the applicant;
(c) the nature and quality of the technical staff employed or to be employed by the applicant;
(d) such other matters as may be prescribed.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2) but subject to the provisions of Sub-section (1), the State Government may for any special reasons to be recorded and with the previous approval of the Central Government, grant a prospecting licence or a mining lease to an applicant whose application was received later in preference to an applicant whose application was received earlier.
56. The above provision was substituted by Act 38 of 1999 with effect from December 18, 1999. After substitution, Section 11 now reads as under:
S.11. Preferential right of certain persons.-(1) Where a reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence has been granted in respect of any land, the permit holder or the licensee shall have a preferential right for obtaining a prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, in respect of that land over any other person:
Provided that the State Government is satisfied that the permit holder or the licensee, as the case may be,
(a) has undertaken reconnaissance operations or prospecting operations, as the case may be, to establish mineral resources in such land;
(b) has not committed any breach of the terms and conditions of the reconnaissance permit or the prospecting licence;
(c) has not become ineligible under the provisions of this Act; and
(d) has not failed to apply for grant of prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, within three months after the expiry of reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence, as the case may be, or within such further period, as may be extended by the said Government.
(2) Subject to the provisions of Sub-section (1), where the State Government has not notified in the Official Gazette the area for grant of reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, and two or more persons have applied for a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or a mining lease in respect of any land in such area, the applicant whose application was received earlier, shall have the preferential right to be considered for grant of reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, over the applicant whose application was received later:
Provided that where an area is available for grant of reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, and the State Government has invited applications by notification in the Official Gazette for grant of such permit, licence or lease, all the applications received during the period specified in such notification and the applications which had been received prior to the publication of such notification in respect of the lands within such area and had not been disposed of, shall be deemed to have been received on the same day for the purposes of assigning priority under this Sub-section:
Provided further that where any such applications are received on the same day, the State Government, after taking into consideration the matter specified in Sub-section (3), may grant the reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, to such one of the applicants as it may deem fit.
(3) The matters referred to in Sub-section (2) are the following:
(a) any special knowledge of, or experience in, reconnaissance operations, prospecting operations or mining operations, as the case may be, possessed by the applicant.
(b) the financial resources of the applicant;
(c) the nature and quality of the technical staff employed or to be employed by the applicant;
(d) the investment which the applicant proposes to make in the mines and in the industry based on the minerals;
(e) such other matters as may be prescribed.
(4) Subject to the provisions of Sub-section (1), where the State Government notifies in the Official Gazette an area for grant of reconnaissance permit, prospecting license or mining lease, as the case may be, all the applications received during the period as specified in such notification, which shall not be less than thirty days, shall be considered simultaneously as if all such applications have been received on the same day and the State Government, after taking into consideration the matter specified in Sub-section (3), may grant the reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, to such one of the applicants as it may deem fit.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2), but subject to the provisions of Sub-section (1), the State Government may, for any special reasons to be recorded, grant a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, to an applicant whose application was received later in preference to an applicant whose application was received earlier:
Provided that in respect of minerals specified in the First Schedule, prior approval of the Central Government shall be obtained before passing any order under this Sub-section.
57. Section 13 of the 1957 Act empowers Central Government to make rules in respect of minerals. By virtue of the power conferred upon the Central Government Under Section 13(2)(e), 1960 Rules have been framed for regulating the grant of, inter alia, mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith.
58. Section 14 states that the provisions of Sections 5 to 13 (both inclusive) shall not apply to quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals. Section 15 empowers State Governments to make rules in respect of minor minerals.
59. Section 16 provides for power to modify mining leases granted before 25th October, 1949. The original Sub-section (1) of Section 16 mandated that all mining leases granted before October 25, 1949 shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of 1957 Act and the Rules made Under Sections 13 and 18 after the commencement of 1957 Act. Then it provided that if the Central Government was of the opinion that in the interest of mineral development it was expedient so to do, it might permit any person to hold one or more such mining leases covering in any one State a total area in excess of that specified in Clause (b) of Section 6 or for a period exceeding that specified in Sub-section (1) of Section 8. Sub-section (1) of Section 16 has been amended in 1972 and 1994.
60. By virtue of Section 17, the Central Government has been given special powers to undertake prospecting or mining operations in certain cases. Section 17(1) was amended in 1972. After amendment, Section 17(1) reads as under:
S. 17.-Special powers of Central Government to undertake prospecting or mining operations in certain lands.-(1) The provisions of this Section shall apply in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the Government of a State or any other person.
61. Section 17A was inserted in the 1957 Act by Act 37 of 1987. Thereafter, Sub-section (1A) was added in Section 17A by Act 25 of 1994. Section 17A, after its amendment in 1994, reads as follows:
S. 17A. Reservation of area for purposes of conservation.-(1) The Central Government, with a view to conserving any mineral and after consultation with the State Government, may reserve any area not already held under any prospecting licence or mining lease and, where it proposes to do so, it shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify the boundaries of such area and the mineral or minerals in respect of which such area will be reserved.
(1A) The Central Government may in consultation with the State Government, reserve any area not already held under any prospecting licence or mining lease, for undertaking prospecting or mining operations through a Government company or corporation owned or controlled by it, and where it proposes to do so, it shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify the boundaries of such area and the mineral or minerals in respect of which such area will be reserved.
(2) The State Government may, with the approval of the Central Government, reserve any area not already held under any prospecting licence or mining lease, for undertaking prospecting or mining operations through a Government company or corporation owned or controlled by it and where it proposes to do so, it shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify the boundaries of such area and the mineral or minerals in respect of which such areas will be reserved.
(3) Where in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section (1A) or Sub-section (2) the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, undertakes prospecting or mining operations in any area in which the minerals vest in a private person, it shall be liable, to pay prospecting fee, royalty, surface rent or dead rent, as the case may be, from time to time at the same rate at which it would have been payable under this Act if such prospecting or mining operations had been undertaken by a private person under prospecting licence or mining lease.
62. Section 18 states that it shall be the duty of the Central Government to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or mining operations and for such purposes the Central Government may make rules. Sub-section (2) of Section 18 empowers the Central Government to make rules and provide for the matters stated in Clause (a) to Clause (q).
63. Section 18A was inserted in 1957 Act to enable the Central Government to authorize Geological Survey of India to carry out necessary investigation for the purpose of obtaining information with regard to availability of any mineral in or under any land in relation to which any prospecting licence or mining lease has been granted by a State Government or by any other person. Proviso that follows Sub-section (1) of Section 18A provides that in cases of prospecting licences or mining leases granted by a State Government, no such authorization shall be made except after consultation with the State Government. To the extent Section 18A is relevant, it is reproduced as under:
S. 18A. Power to authorize Geological Survey of India, etc., to make investigation.-(1) Where the Central Government is of opinion that for the conservation and development of minerals in India, it is necessary to collect as precise information as possible with regard to any mineral available in or under any land in relation to which any prospecting licence or mining lease has been granted, whether by the State Government or by any other person, the Central Government may authorize the Geological Survey of India, or such other authority or agency as it may specify in this behalf, to carry out such detailed investigation for the purpose of obtaining such information as may be necessary:
Provided that in the cases of prospecting licences or mining leases granted by a State Government, no such authorization shall be made except after consultation with the State Government.
xxx
(6) The costs of the investigation made under this Section shall be borne by the Central Government.
Provided that where the State Government or other person in whom the minerals are vested or the holder of any prospecting licence or mining lease applies to the Central Government to furnish to it or him a copy of the report submitted under Sub-section (5), that State Government or other person or the holder of a prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, shall bear such reasonable part of the costs of investigation as the Central Government may specify in this behalf and shall, on payment of such part of the costs of investigation, be entitled to receive from the Central Government a true copy of the report submitted to it under Sub-section (5).
64. Section 19 provides that any prospecting licence or mining lease granted, renewed or acquired in contravention of the provisions of 1957 Act or any rules or orders made thereunder shall be void and of no effect. Section 19 underwent amendments in 1994 and 1999 but these amendments are not of much relevance for the purposes of these matters.
65. By virtue of Section 29, the rules made or purporting to have been made under the 1948 Act insofar as consistent with the matters provided in 1957 Act were made to continue until superseded by the rules made under the 1957 Act. Thus, the rules framed under 1948 Act continued to operate until 1960 Rules were framed.
Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 and the Amendments
66. 1960 Rules were framed by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 13 of the 1957 Act. These Rules were published on November 11, 1960. As noticed above, until these Rules came into effect, the Rules framed under 1948 Act remained operative.
67. By virtue of Rule 8, the provisions of Chapters II, III and IV have been made applicable to the grant of reconnaissance permits as well as grant and renewal of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of the land in which the minerals vest in the State Government.
68. Rule 9 provides that an application for a prospecting licence and its renewal in respect of land in which the minerals vest in Government shall be made to the State Government in Form B and Form D respectively. The State Government is empowered to relax the provisions of Clause (d) of Sub-rule (2) of Rule 9.
69. Chapter-IV deals with grant of mining leases in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the Government. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 22 provides that an application for the grant of a mining lease in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the Government shall be made to the State Government in Form I. Sub-rule (4) of Rule 22 provides that on receipt of the application for the grant of a mining lease, the State Government shall take decision to grant precise area and communicate such decision to the applicant. The applicant, on receipt of communication from the State Government of the precise areas to be granted, is required to submit a mining plan within a period of six months or such other period as may be allowed by the State Government, to the Central Government for its approval. The applicant is required to submit the mining plan, duly approved by the Central Government or by an officer duly authorized by the Central Government, to the State Government to grant mining lease over that area. Sub-rule (4A) of Rule 22 is a non-obstinate clause and empowers the State Government to approve mining plan of open cast mines (mines other than the underground mines) in respect of non-metallic or industrial minerals set out in Clauses (i) to (xxix) in their respective territorial jurisdiction. Such power of approval of mining plan has to be exercised by the State Government through officer or officers having qualification, experience and post and pay-scale as set out therein. Under Sub-rule (4B) of Rule 22, the Central Government or the State Government has to dispose of the application for approval of mining plan within a period of ninety days from the date of receiving such application.
70. Rule 22D substituted by Notification dated January 17, 2000 makes provision for a minimum size of the mining lease.
71. Rule 26 that was substituted by Notification dated July 18, 1963 was amended in 1979, 1988, 1991 and 2002. Rule 26 now reads as under:
26. Refusal of application for grant and renewal of mining lease.- (1) The State Government may, after giving an opportunity of being heard and for reasons to be recorded in writing and communicated to the applicant, refuse to grant or renew a mining lease over the whole or part of the area applied for.
(2) An application for the grant or renewal of a mining lease made under Rule 22 or Rule 24A, as the case may be, shall not be refused by the State Government only on the ground that Form I or Form J, as the case may be, is not complete in all material particulars, or is not accompanied by the documents referred to in Sub-clauses (d),(e),(f),(g) and (h) of Clause (i) of sub-rule 22.
(3) Where it appears that the application is not complete in all material particulars or is not accompanied by the required documents, the State Government shall, by notice, require the applicant to supply the omission or, as the case may be, furnish the documents, without delay and in any case not later than thirty days from the date of receipt of the said notice by the applicant.
72. Rule 31 provides for the time period within which lease is to be executed. It also provides for the date of commencement of the period.
73. Rule 58, as it originally stood, read as under:
58. Availability of areas for regrant to be notified. (1) No area which was previously held or which is being held under a prospecting licence or a mining lease as the case may be, or in respect of which the order granting licence or lease has been revoked under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 or Sub-rule (1) of Rule 31, shall be available for grant unless-
(a) an entry to the effect made in the register referred to in Sub-rule (2) of Rule 21 or Sub-rule (2) of Rule 40, as the case may be in ink; and
(b) the date from which the area shall be available for grant is notified in the Official Gazette at least thirty days in advance.
(2) The Central Government may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, relax the provisions of Sub-rule (1) in any special case.
Rule 58 was amended on November 16, 1980 and the amended Rule 58 read as under:
58. Reservation of area for exploitation in the public sector etc.-The State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, reserve any area for the exploitation by the Government, a Corporation established by the Central, State or Provincial Act or a Government company within the meaning of Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).
Later on, Rule 58 has been omitted.
74. Rule 59, as originally framed in 1960 Rules, read as under:
59. Availability of certain areas for grant to be notified.-In the case of any land which is otherwise available for the grant of a prospecting licence or a mining lease but in respect of which the State Government has refused to grant a prospecting licence or a mining lease on the ground that the land should be reserved for any purpose, other than prospecting or mining for minerals, the State Government shall, as soon as such land becomes again available for the grant of a prospecting or mining lease, grant the licence or lease after following the procedure laid down in Rule 58.
The original Rule 59 was amended vide Notification dated July 9, 1963. After the said amendment, the Rule read as under:
59. -Availability of certain areas for grant to be notified.-In the case of any land which is otherwise available for the grant of a prospecting licence or a mining lease but in respect of which the State Government has refused to grant a prospecting licence or a mining lease on the ground that the land should be reserved for any purpose, the State Government shall, as soon as such land becomes again available for the grant of a prospecting or mining lease, grant the licence or lease after following the procedure laid down in Rule 58.
Rule 59 was again amended in 1980. After amendment, the said rule read as under:
59. Availability of area for grant to be notified-(1) No area-
(a) which was previously held or which is being held under a prospecting licence or a mining lease; or
(b) in respect of which an order had been made for the grant of a prospecting licence or mining lease, but the applicant has died before the grant of the licence or the execution of lease, as the case may be; or
(c) in respect of which the order granting a licence or lease has been revoked under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 or Sub-rule (1) of Rule 31; or
(d) in respect of which a notification has been issued under Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (4) of Section 17; or
(e) which has been reserved by Government under Rule 58,
shall be available for grant unless
(i) an entry to the effect that the area is available for grant is made in the register referred to in sub-rule (2) of Rule 21 or Sub-rule (2) of Rule 40, as the case may be, in ink; and
(ii) the availability of the area for grant is notified in the Official Gazette and specifying a date (being a date not earlier than thirty days from the date of the publication of such notification in the Official Gazette) from which such area shall be available for grant:
Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply to the renewal of a lease in favour of the original lessee or his legal heirs notwithstanding the fact that the lease has already expired:
Provided further that where an area reserved under Rule 58 is proposed to be granted to a Government Company, no notification under Clause (ii) shall be required to be issued.
(2) The Central Government may, for reasons to be recorded in writing relax the provisions of Sub-rule (1) in any special case.
Rule 59 was further amended on April 13, 1988. The amended Rule 59 reads as under:
59. Availability of area for regrant to be notified:(1) No area-
(a) which was previously held or which is being held under a prospecting licence or a mining lease; or
(b) in respect of which an order had been made for the grant of a prospecting licence or mining lease, but the applicant has died before the grant of the licence or the execution of the lease, as the case may be; or
(c) in respect of which the order granting a licence or lease has been revoked, under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 or Sub-rule (1) of Rule 31; or
(d) in respect of which a notification has been issued under Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (4) of Section 17; or
(e) which has been reserved by State Government under Rule 58, or Under Section 17-A of the Act shall be available for grant unless
(i) an entry to the effect that the area is available for grant is made in the register referred to in Sub-rule (2) of Rule 21 or Sub-rule (2) of Rule 40, as - the case may be, in ink; and
(ii) the availability of the area for grant is notified in the Official Gazette and specifying a date (being a date not earlier than thirty days from the date of the publication, of such notification in the Official Gazette) from which such area shall be available for grant:
Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply to the renewal of a lease in favour of the original lessee or his legal heirs notwithstanding the fact that the lease has already expired:
Provided further that where an area reserved under Rule 58 or Under Section 17-A of the Act to be granted to a Government Company, no notification under Clause (ii) shall be required to be issued;
(2) The Central Government may, for reasons to be recorded in writing relax the provisions of Sub-rule (1) in any special case.
75. Rule 60 of the 1960 Rules has been amended twice, first vide Notification dated January 16, 1980 and thereafter by the Notification dated January 17, 2000. After amendment, Rule 60 reads as under:
60. Premature applications.-Applications for the grant of a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease in respect of areas whose availability for grant is required to be notified under Rule 59 shall, if
(a) no notification has been issued, under that rule; or
(b) where any such notification has been issued, the period specified in the notification has not expired, shall be deemed to be premature and shall not be entertained.
76. Rule 63 of the 1960 Rules provides that where previous approval of the Central Government is required under the 1957 Act or the 1960 Rules, the application for such approval shall be made to the Central Government through the State Government.
77. The above provisions give us complete view of the statutory framework and legal regime with regard to Regulation of mines and mineral development and the role and powers of the State Governments in that regard.
Decisions
Hingir-Rampur Coal Company Ltd.
78. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Hingir-Rampur Coal Company Ltd. MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459 was concerned with the question of the validity of Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act, 1952. Inter-alia, the contention raised on behalf of the Petitioners was that even if the cess imposed thereunder was a 'fee' relatable to Entries 23 and/or 66 of List II, the same would be ultra vires Entry 54 of List I in light of declaration made in Section 2 of the 1948 Act which read, 'it is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Central Government should take under its control the Regulation of mines and oilfields and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided' and other provisions.
79. The majority view considered the above contention as follows:
23. The next question which arises is, even if the cess is a fee and as such may be relatable to Entries 23 and 66 in List II its validity is still open to challenge because the legislative competence of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to Regulation and development under the control of the Union; and that takes us to Entry 54 in List I. This Entry reads thus: "Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such Regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest". The effect of reading the two Entries together is clear. The jurisdiction of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is subject to the limitation imposed by the latter part of the said Entry. If Parliament by its law has declared that Regulation and development of mines should in public interest be under the control of the Union, to the extent of such declaration the jurisdiction of the State Legislature is excluded. In other words, if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by Parliament as required by Entry 54, and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires, not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because the State Legislature had no jurisdiction to pass the law. The limitation imposed by the latter part of Entry 23 is a limitation on the legislative competence of the State Legislature itself. This position is not in dispute.
24. ... If it is held that this Act contains the declaration referred to in Entry 23 there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covers the field of conservation and development of minerals, and the said field is indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act. What Entry 23 provides is that the legislative competence of the State Legislature is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to Regulation and development under the control of the Union, and Entry 54 in List I requires a declaration by Parliament by law that Regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the Union in public interest. Therefore, if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals, and if it contains the requisite declaration, then it would not be competent to the State Legislature to pass an Act in respect of the subject-matter covered by the said declaration. In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced; all that this required is a declaration by Parliament that it is expedient in the public interest to take the Regulation and development of mines under the control of the Union. In such a case the test must be whether the legislative declaration covers the field or not. Judged by this test there can be no doubt that the field covered by the impugned Act is covered by the Central Act LIII of 1948.
25. It still remains to consider whether Section 2 of the said Act amounts in law to a declaration by Parliament as required by Article 54. When the said Act was passed in 1948 the legislative powers of the Central and the Provincial Legislatures were governed by the relevant Entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution Act of 1935. Entry 36 in List I corresponds to the present Entry 54 in List I. It reads thus: "Regulation of Mines and Oil Fields and mineral development to the extent to which such Regulation and development under Dominion control is declared by Dominion law to be expedient in public interest". It would be noticed that the declaration required by Entry 36 is a declaration by Dominion law. Reverting then to Section 2 of the said Act it is clear that the declaration contained in the said Section is put in the passive voice; but in the context there would be no difficulty in holding that the said declaration by necessary implication has been made by Dominion law. It is a declaration contained in a Section passed by the Dominion Legislature and so it is obvious that it is a declaration by a Dominion law, but the question is: Can this declaration by a Dominion law be regarded constitutionally as declaration by Parliament which is required by Entry 54 in List I.
The majority view found that the declaration by Parliament required under Entry 54, List I was absent as the declaration Under Section 2 of the 1948 Act by the Dominion Legislature was not held equivalent to declaration by the Parliament Under Section 2 of the 1957 Act.
M.A. Tulloch and Company
80. In M.A. Tulloch and Company MANU/SC/0021/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 1284, a Constitution Bench of this Court was concerned with legality of certain demands of fee under the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act, 1952 (Orissa Act). The Constitution Bench considered the question, 'whether the extent of control and Regulation provided by the 1957 Act takes within its fold the area or the subject covered by Act 27 of 1952 Act'. The High Court had held that fee imposed by the Orissa Act was rendered ineffective in view of the 1957 Act. The State of Orissa was in appeal from that judgment. The Court in para 5 and para 6 of the Report noted as follows:
5. Before proceeding further it is necessary to specify briefly the legislative power on the relevant topic, for it is on the precise wording of the entries in the 7th Schedule to the Constitution and the scope, purpose and effect of the State and the Central legislations which we have referred to earlier that the decision of the point turns. Article 246(1) reads:
Notwithstanding anything in Clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the Union List)
and we are concerned in the present case with the State power in the State field. The relevant clause in that context is clause (3) of the Article which runs:
Subject to Clauses (1) and (2), the legislature of any State... has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'State List').
Coming now to the Seventh Schedule, Entry 23 of the State List vests in the State legislature power to enact laws on the subject of 'Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to Regulation and development under the control of the Union'. It would be seen that "subject" to the provisions of List I the power of the State to enact Legislation, on the topic of "mines and mineral development" is plenary. The relevant provision in List I is, as already noticed, Entry 54 of the Union List. It may be mentioned that this scheme of the distribution of legislative power between the Centre and the States is not new but is merely a continuation of the State of affairs which prevailed under the Government of India Act, 1935 which included a provision on the lines of Entry 54 of the Union List which then bore the number Item 36 of the Federal List and an entry corresponding to Entry 23 in the State List which bore the same number in the Provincial Legislative List. There is no controversy that the Central Act has been enacted by Parliament in exercise of the legislative power contained in Entry 54 or as regards the Central Act containing a declaration in terms of what is required by Entry 54 for it enacts by Section 2:
It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the Regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided.
It does not need much argument to realise that to the extent to which the Union Government had taken under "its control" "the Regulation and development of minerals" so much was withdrawn from the ambit of the power of the State legislature under Entry 23 and legislation of the State which had rested on the existence of power under that entry would to the extent of that "control" be superseded or be rendered ineffective, for here we have a case not of mere repugnancy between the provisions of the two enactments but of a denudation or deprivation of State legislative power by the declaration which Parliament is empowered to make and has made.
6. It would, however, be apparent that the States would lose legislative competence only to the "extent to which Regulation and development under the control of the Union has been declared by Parliament to be expedient in the public interest". The crucial enquiry has therefore to be directed to ascertain this "extent" for beyond it the legislative power of the State remains unimpaired. As the legislation by the State is in the case before us the earlier one in point of time, it would be logical first to examine and analyse the State Act and determine its purpose, width and scope and the area of its operation and then consider to what "extent" the Central Act cuts into it or trenches on it.
In para 9, the question under consideration was whether 'the extent of control and Regulation' provided by 1957 Act took within its fold the area or the subject covered by the Orissa Act. This Court in para 11 observed that the matter was concluded by earlier decision in Hingir-Rampur Coal Company Ltd. MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459. While following Hingir-Rampur Coal Company Ltd. MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459, it was observed in para 12 of the Report that Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 18 of 1957 Act were wider in scope and amplitude and conferred larger powers on the Central Government than the corresponding provisions of the 1948 Act.
Baijnath Kadio
81. In Baijnath Kadio MANU/SC/0352/1969 : 1969 (3) SCC 838, the validity of proviso (2) to Section 10(2) added by Bihar Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1964 (Bihar Act 4 of 1965) and the operation of Rule 20(2) added on December 10, 1964 by a Notification of Governor in the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1964 were in issue. The Court referred to the Government of India Act, 1935, 1948 Act and 1957 Act in light of Entry 54 of List I and Entry 23 of List II and the earlier decisions in Hingir-Rampur Coal Company Ltd. MANU/SC/0037/1960 : AIR 1961 SC 459 and M.A. Tulloch and Company MANU/SC/0021/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 1284 and observed as under:
13. ...Entry 54 of the Union List speaks both of Regulation of mines and minerals development and Entry 23 is subject to Entry 54. It is open to Parliament to declare that it is expedient in the public interest that the control should rest in Central Government. To what extent such a declaration can go is for Parliament to determine and this must be commensurate with public interest. Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down, the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by Parliament. Any legislation by the State after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the State Legislature. This proposition is also self-evident that no attempt was rightly made to contradict it. There are also two decisions of this Court reported in the Hingir Rampur Coal Company Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Orissa and Ors. and State of Orissa v. M.A. Tulloch and Company in which the matter is discussed. The only dispute, therefore, can be to what extent the declaration by Parliament leaves any scope for legislation by the State Legislature. If the impugned legislation falls within the ambit of such scope it will be valid; if outside it, then it must be declared invalid.
14. The declaration is contained in Section 2 of Act 67 of 1957 and speaks of the taking under the control of the Central Government the Regulation of mines and development of minerals to the extent provided in the Act itself. We have thus not to look outside Act 67 of 1957 to determine what is left within the competence of the State Legislature but have to work it out from the terms of that Act. In this connection we may notice what was decided in the two cases of this Court. In the Hingir Rampur case a question had arisen whether the Act of 1948 so completely covered the field of conservation and development of minerals as to leave no room for State legislation. It. was held that the declaration was effective even if the rules contemplated under the Act of 1948 had not been made. However, considering further whether a declaration made by a Dominion Law could be regarded as a declaration made by Parliament for the purpose of Entry 54, it was held that it could not and there was thus a lacuna which the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950 could not remove. Therefore, it was held that there was room for legislation by the State Legislature.
15. In the M.A. Tulloch case the firm was working a mining lease granted under the Act of 1948. The State Legislature of Orissa then passed the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act, 1952 and levied a fee for the development of mining areas within the State. After the provisions came into force a demand was made for payment of fees due from July 1957 to March 1958 and the demand was challenged. The High Court held that after the coming into force of Act 67 of 1957 the Orissa Act must be held to be non existent. It was held on appeal that since Act 67 of 1957 contained the requisite declaration by Parliament under Entry 54 and that Act covered the same field as the Act of 1948 in regard to mines and mineral development, the ruling in Hingir Rampur's case applied and as Sections 18(1) and (2) of the Act 67 of 1957 were very wide they ruled out legislation by the State Legislature. Where a superior legislature evinced an intention to cover the whole field, the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after must be held to be overborne. It was laid down that inconsistency could be proved not by a detailed comparison of the provisions of the conflicting Acts but by the mere existence of two pieces of legislation. As Section 18(1) covered the entire field, there was no scope for the argument that till rules were framed under that Section, room was available.
Amritlal Nathubhai Shah
82. In Amritlal Nathubhai Shah MANU/SC/0037/1976 : 1976 (4) SCC 108, a three-Judge Bench of this Court was concerned with an issue similar to the controversy presented before us. That was a case relating to grant of mining leases for bauxite in the reserved areas in the State of Gujarat. On December 31, 1963, the Government of Gujarat issued a Notification intimating that lands in all talukas of Kutch district and in Kalyanpur taluka of Jamnagar district had been reserved for exploitation of bauxite in the public sector. By another Notification of February 26, 1964 in respect of all areas of Jamnagar and Junagarh districts, the exploitation of bauxite was reserved in the public sector. The Appellants therein made applications to the Government of Gujarat for grant of mining leases for bauxite in the reserved areas. Though there were no other applications, the State Government rejected the applications of the Appellants on the ground that areas had already been notified as reserved for the public sector. The Appellants, aggrieved by the order of the State Government moved the Central Government invoking its revisional jurisdiction. The Central Government rejected the revision applications. The Appellants then moved the High Court but they were unsuccessful there and from the common judgment of the High Court and the certificate granted by it, the matter reached this Court. The Court considered Entry 54 of List I, declaration made by Parliament in Section 2 of 1957 Act and State Legislature's power under Entry 23 of List II, and observed that in pursuance of its exclusive power to make laws with respect to the matters enumerated in Entry 54 of List I, Parliament specifically declared in Section 2 of the 1957 Act that it was expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the Regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided in the Act. The State Legislature's power under Entry 23 of List II was, thus, taken away and the Regulation of mines and development of minerals had to be in accordance with 1957 Act and 1960 Rules. While saying so, this Court held as follows:
3. ...The mines and the minerals in question (bauxite) were, however, in the territory of the State of Gujarat and, as was stated in the orders which were passed by the Central Government on the revision applications of the Appellants, the State Government is the "owner of minerals" within its territory, and the minerals "vest" in it. There is nothing in the Act or the Rules to detract from this basic fact. That was why the Central Government stated further in its revisional orders that the State Government had the "inherent right to reserve any particular area for exploitation in the public sector". It is therefore quite clear that, in the absence of any law or contract etc. to the contrary, bauxite, as a mineral, and the mines thereof, vest in the State of Gujarat and no person has any right to exploit it otherwise then in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules. Section 10 of the Act and Chapters II, III and IV of the Rules, deal with the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in the land in which the minerals vest in the Government of a State. That was why the Appellants made their applications to the State Government.
83. In Amritlal Nathubhai Shah MANU/SC/0037/1976 : 1976 (4) SCC 108, this Court referred to Section 4 of the 1957 Act and held that there was nothing in 1957 Act or 1960 Rules to require that the restrictions imposed by Chapters II,III and IV of the 1960 Rules would be applicable even if State Government itself wanted to exploit a mineral for, it was its own property.
