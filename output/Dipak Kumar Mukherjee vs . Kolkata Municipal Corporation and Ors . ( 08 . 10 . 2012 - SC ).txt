Disposition:
Appeal Allowed
Case Note:
Civil - Violation of sanctioned planned of building - High Court had affirmed order of Single Judge wherein he disposed of Application filed by Appellant with direction that objection raised by Appellant against unauthorized construction be decided by competent authority after hearing affected parties - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, Respondent had violated sanctioned plan by making unauthorized construction of buildings - Held, it was observed that Respondent No. 7 was guilty not only of violating sanctioned plan and relevant provisions of 1980 Act and Rules framed, but also of cheating those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction under bona fide belief that Respondent No. 7 had constructed building as per sanctioned plan - However with demolition of unauthorized construction some of such persons would become shelter less - Therefore it was necessary that Respondent No. 7 was directed to compensate them by refunding cost of flat, with interest - Further while preparing master plans/zonal plans, Planning Authority took into consideration prospectus of future development and accordingly provided for basic amenities - Thus unauthorized construction of buildings not only destroyed concept of planned development which was beneficial to public but also places unbearable burden on basic amenities and facilities provided by public authorities - Hence construction of such buildings became hazardous for public and created traffic congestion - Therefore it was imperative for concerned public authorities not only to demolish such construction but also impose adequate penalty on wrongdoer - Therefore Order passed by High Court was liable to be set aside - Appeal allowed.

Ratio Decidendi

"Court shall pass order of demolition of unauthorized construction of building if it is based on violated sanctioned planed."
JUDGMENT
G.S. Singhvi, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. In last four decades, the menace of illegal and unauthorised constructions of buildings and other structures in different parts of the country has acquired monstrous proportion. This Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of planned development of the cities and either approved the orders passed by the High Court or itself gave directions for demolition of illegal constructions - (1) K.

3. In K. Ramadas Shenoy v. Chief Officers, Town Municipal Council (supra), the resolution passed by the Municipal Committee authorising construction of a cinema theatre was challenged on the ground that the site was earmarked for the construction of Kalyan Mantap cum Lecture Hall and the same could not have been used for any other purpose. The High Court held that the cinema theatre could not be constructed at the disputed site but declined to quash the resolution of the Municipal Committee on the ground that the theatre owner had spent huge amount. While setting aside the High Court's order, this Court observed:
An illegal construction of a cinema building materially affects the right to or enjoyment of the property by persons residing in the residential area. The Municipal Authorities owe a duty and obligation under the statute to see that the residential area is not spoilt by unauthorised construction. The Scheme is for the benefit of the residents of the locality. The Municipality acts in aid of the Scheme. The rights of the residents in the area are invaded by an illegal construction of a cinema building. It has to be remembered that a scheme in a residential area means planned orderliness in accordance with the requirements of the residents. If the scheme is nullified by arbitrary acts in excess and derogation of the powers of the Municipality the courts will quash orders passed by Municipalities in such cases.
The Court enforces the performance of statutory duty by public bodies as obligation to rate payers who have a legal right to demand compliance by a local authority with its duty to observe statutory rights alone. The Scheme here is for the benefit of the public. There is special interest in the performance of the duty. All the residents in the area have their personal interest in the performance of the duty. The special and substantial interest of the residents in the area is injured by the illegal construction."
