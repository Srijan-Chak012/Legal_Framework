Case Note:
Commercial - Levy of sugar - Price determination - Requisite factors - Section 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 - Clause 5A of the Sugarcane Control Order - U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 - Appeals filed by various owners of sugar mills who purchased sugarcane from the farmers, concerns with the determination of price of sugar for the sugar years 1983-84 and 1984-85 - Central Government determined the price of levy sugar on the basis of 100 per cent mopping up - State of Uttar Pradesh under Section 16, U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 enforced a price to be paid by the owners of the sugar mill to the producers known as State Advisory Price (ASP) - Writ applications were filed questioning the mode of calculation resorted to by the Central Government in determining the price of levy sugar, particularly, the effect of Clause 5A of the Sugarcane Control Order, as also ASP levied by the State - Divergent views were taken by Division Benches of the High Court - Hence, the present appeal - Petitioners contented that 100 per cent mopping up was illegal and the liability of the sugar producers towards the cane growers was to be considered before arriving at the price of levy sugar - What are the factors which are required to be taken into consideration by the Central Government for determining the price of levy sugar in exercise of its power under Section 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 - Held, direction by the Central Government to the owners of the sugar mills that a part of their products would be sold at a price determined by it is within its power under Section 3(2)(f) of the Act - Determination of price in terms of the provisions of the Act is a legislative function - However, if a price is determined without applying the principles underlying the factors enunciated in Section 3(3C) of the Act, the superior Courts can issue requisite direction - In the present case, the relevant factor that the Central Government has to take into consideration was Sub-Clause (iv) of Clause 5A of the Order which mandates that the additional price determination under Sub-Clause (ii) shall be paid by the producer of sugar to the sugarcane grower - If the actual price payable to the cane growers is absolutely relevant for determining the price of levy of sugar, then the effect of payment of an extra amount in terms of State Advisory Price cannot be refused to be taken into consideration - These elements would come either under Clause (b) or Clause (d) of Section 3(3C) of the Act - 100 per cent mopping held to be illegal - Direction to Central Government to re-fix the price of levy sugar while taking into consideration all the relevant factors - Appeal disposed of
Ratio Decidendi:
"If the actual price payable to the cane growers is absolutely relevant for determining the price of levy of sugar, then the effect of payment of an extra amount in terms of State Advisory Price cannot be refused to be taken into consideration while fixing the price of levy sugar."

JUDGMENT
S.B. Sinha, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. What are the factors which are required to be taken into consideration by the Central Government for determining the price of levy sugar in exercise of its power under Section 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (the Act) is the question involved herein.
3. Before us, there are various owners of sugar mills who purchased sugarcane from the farmers.
4. Section 3(2)(f) of the Act empowers the Central Government to fix compulsory quota of sugar produced by a sugar producer in the manner prescribed by the Central Government including the price thereof at which the same is to be sold. It is known as "levy sugar". The rest of the sugar, however, can be sold by the producers in free market. It is known as "free sugar".
5. The factors which are relevant to be taken into consideration by Central Government is contained in Section 3(3C) of the Act which includes:
(a) The minimum price, if any fixed for Sugarcane by the Central Government.
(b) The manufacturing cost of sugar.
(c) The duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; and
(d) Securing a reasonable return on the Capital employed in the business of manufacturing, and different price may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kind of sugar.
6. In these appeals, we are concerned with the determination of price of sugar for the sugar years 1983-84 and 1984-85.
7. The Central Government, in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section 3 of the Act, made an order known as the Sugarcane Control Order. Clause 5A of the said order reads, thus:
Clause 5A. Additional price for sugarcane purchased on or after 1st October 1974:
(1) Where a producer for sugar or his agent purchases sugarcane, from a sugarcane grower during each sugar year, he shall, in addition to the minimum sugarcane price fixed under Clause 3, pay to the sugarcane grower an additional price, if found due, in accordance with the provisions of the second Schedule annexed to this Order.
x x x
(4) The additional price determined under Sub-clause (2) or Sub-clause (3) as the case may be, shall be paid by the producer of sugar to the sugarcane grower, at such time and in such manner as the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, from time to time, direct.
(5) No additional price determined under Sub-clause (2) or Sub-clause (3), as the case may be, shall become payable by a producer of sugar who pays a price higher than the minimum sugarcane price fixed under clause (3) to the sugarcane grower.
Provided that the price so paid shall in no case be less than the total price comprising the minimum sugarcane price fixed under Clause (3) and the additional price fixed determined under Sub-clause (2) or Sub-clause (3), as the case may be.
(6) Where any extra price is paid by the producer of sugar to the sugarcane grower for the supply sugarcane in addition to the minimum sugarcane price fixed under Clause (3), the extra price so paid shall be adjusted against the additional sugarcane price determined under Sub-clause (2) or Sub-clause (3), as the case may be, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to the sugarcane grower.
(7)** Subject to the provisions of Sub-clause (4), the additional price shall become payable to a sugarcane grower, if he, in performance of his agreement with a producer of sugar, supplies not less than 85% o the sugarcane so agreed:
(* Provided that the Central Government or the State Government as the case may be, may if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within a further period of thirty days, admit if presented within a further period of fifteen days.
(**Provided that the additional price shall become payable to a sugar grower even when he supplies less than 85% of the sugarcane so agreed, if for the same supply he has not been subjected to any penalty by or under any Central or State Act or any rules or orders made thereunder for his failure to supply 85% of sugarcane so agreed.
8. Some of the States in India, however, even prior to coming into force of the said Parliamentary Act, had enacted Legislative Acts, inter alia, providing for to regulation and control of production of sugar.
9. We may notice that in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Government of Uttar Pradesh enacted Sugar Control Act, 1938. The Legislature of the State of Uttar Pradesh, furthermore, enacted UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953.
10. We may divide the mode and manner in which the prices for levy sugar were to be fixed by the Central Government in three different periods.
11. Prior to 1.10.1974, the Central Government, for arriving at the price of levy sugar, used to mop up the entire excess realization of amount received by the owners of the sugar mills out of sale of free sugar as no restriction thereupon was imposed.
12. Levy sugar price also used to be premised on Statutory Minimum Price (SMP), a factor specified in Clause (a) of Section 3(3C) of the Act which is to be determined in terms of Clause (3) of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 and not on the actual cane prices paid by the sugar factories to the cane growers.
13. The Central Government, however, appointed a Committee commonly known as Bhargava Commission. It gave its recommendations, inter alia, opining that mopping up of the extra sale realization should be confined to 50%.
14. The Central Government, relying on or on the basis of the recommendations of the said Commission, introduced Clause 5A in the said Order as a result whereof additional price came to be paid to the growers of sugarcane (1) over and above the SMP by the sugar producers; (2) equivalent amount from free market sales realization came to be retained by the sugar producer.
15. In terms of the said amendment carried out in Sugarcane Control Order in the year 1974, while determining the levy sugar price, 50% of the mopping up was permitted provided the liability of sugar producers towards cane growers to the extent of 50% of excess realization was also taken to be a factor as a part of cost of production. To put it differently, in the earlier scenario whereas entire extra sales realization was applied to reduce the price of levy sugar, upon amendment of the said Order, only 50% of the entire sales realization was considered to be permissible to reduce the price of levy sugar provided the liability of excess realization was also considered as a part of cost of production.
16. Post October 1974, therefore, apart from the levy sugar being based on the SMP only, the same was based on the actual cane price payable by the sugar producer. However, according to the sugar mill owners, the Central Government continued with the exercise of determination of the price of levy sugar on the basis of 100% mopping up and had not been considering the said changed scenario.
17. We may also notice that the State of Uttar Pradesh in purported of its power conferred upon it under Section 16 of the 1953 Act enforced a price to be paid by the owners of the sugar mill to the producers known as State Advisory Price (ASP). Indisputably, the SMP as also the ASP for sugarcane varied from year to year.
18. Questioning the mode of calculation resorted to by the Central Government in determining the price of levy sugar, particularly, the effect of Clause 5A of the Sugarcane Control Order, as also the price levied by the State known as ASP, Mahalakshmi Sugar Mills and Hari Nagar Sugar Mills filed writ applications before the Delhi High Court in the year 1985.
19. Indisputably, similar writ applications for different sugar mills were filed by different owners of the sugar mills.
20. One of the contentions raised in the said writ applications was that 100% mopping up was illegal and the liability of the sugar producers towards the cane growers was to be considered before arriving at the price of levy sugar.
21. One of the matters which came up before this Court is Shri Malaprabha Cooperative Sugar Factor v. Union of India (Malaprabha-I) since reported in MANU/SC/0306/1994 : AIR1994SC1311 wherein this Court, inter alia, held:
102. In paragraph 2.15 the details of the scheme were given as follows:
SUGARCANE SUPPLIES STABILISATION SCHEME
2.15 The details of the scheme are as follows:
(1) A statutory minimum price for sugar-cane related to a basic recovery of 8.6 per cent with a premium for every 0.1 per cent increase in recovery on proportionality basis will be fixed by the Government of India. (2) The minimum price payable by individual factories will be fixed on the basis of the recovery of the factory for the normal crushing period of the previous season.
(3) The statutory minimum price as fixed above shall be paid to all the cane growers subject to Clauses (18) and (19) of this scheme.
(4) The factories shall share their extra sales realisation from sugar with the cane growers who execute agreements for supply of cane and fulfil contracts.
(5) The extra sales realisations shall be calculated according to the following formula:
S=R-L
Where S stands for the amount shareable; R stands for the sales realisations ex-factory excluding excise duty paid or payable to the factory by the purpose; and L stands for sugar price as calculated on the basis of the statutory minimum cane price and according to the Tariff Commission schedules in force at the time. (In periods of control and partial control, L stands for the final levy price of sugar fixed by Government.)
(6) The sales realisations will be in respect of the sugar produced during the season.
(7) The sales realisations will comprise-
(i) the actual amount realised up to and inclusive of September 30; and
(ii) the estimated value of the unsold stocks held at the end of September 30. In case (ii) the value of the stocks will be calculated at the average rate of the sales made during the last fortnight of September.
(8) The excess or shortfall in realisation from the actual sale of the unsold stock of the season after September 30 shall be carried forward to and adjusted in the extra sales realisations of the following season.
(9) The extra realisation shall be divided equally between the factory and the cane growers....
