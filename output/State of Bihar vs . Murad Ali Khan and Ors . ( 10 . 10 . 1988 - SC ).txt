Case Note:
Criminal - Jurisdiction - Section 9(1) and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 - Judicial Magistrate, took cognizance of an offence under Section 9(1) read with Section 51 of Act against Respondent - However, High Court accordingly quashed proceedings against Respondents - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, Magistrate had jurisdiction to take cognizance - Held, a complaint only means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action that some person, whether known or unknown had committed an offence - In exercising that jurisdiction High Court would not embark upon an enquiry whether allegations in complaint were likely to be established by evidence or not - That was function of trial Magistrate when evidence comes before him - Though it was neither possible nor advisable to lay down any inflexible rules to regulate that jurisdiction - Thus, Magistrate taking cognizance of offence and ordering issue of summons to Respondents was restored - Appeal allowed.

Ratio Decidendi

"Proceedings against an Accused in initial stages shall be quashed, if on face of complaint or papers accompanying same, no offence was constituted."
JUDGMENT
M.N. Venkatachaliah, J.
1. SLP 1879 of 1987 is by the State of Bihar for special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution to appeal from the order dated 13-2-1987 of the High Court of Patna in Crl. Misc. 223 of 1987 quashing, in exercise of powers under Section 482 of CrPC 1973, the order dated 1-7-1986 of the Judicial Magistrate, Chaibasa, taking cognizance of an offence under Section 9(1) read with Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 (Act) against respondent-Vikram Singh.
Special Leave Petitions Nos. 1877 of 1987 and 1878 of 1987 arise out of the subsequent two similar orders both dated 18-2-1987 in Criminal Misc. Nos. 258/1987(R) and 259/1987(R) of the High Court quashing the same common order of the said Magistrate dated 1-7-1986 against two other accused, namely, Murad Ali Khan and Faruq Salauddin who are respondents in these two Special Leave Petitions.
2. Special leave was granted and the three appeals were taken up for final hearing, heard and disposed of by this common-judgment, We have heard Shri M.P. Jha, learned Counsel for the State of Bihar and Dr. Chitaley and Shri Nariman for the respondents.
3. The accusation against the three respondents is that on 8-6-86 at 2.00 p.m. they along with two others named in the complaint, shot and killed an elephant in compartment No. 13 of Kundurugutu Range Forest and removed the ivory tusks of the elephant. On 25-6-1986 the Range Officer of Forest of that Range lodged a written complaint with the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Chaibasa, in this behalf alleging offences against respondents under Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The learned Magistrate took cognisance of this offence and ordered issue of process to the accused.
It would appear that at the Police Station, Sonua, a case had been registered under Sections 447, 429 and 379, I.P.C. read with Sections 54 and 39 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and that the matter was under investigation by the police. The respondents, who were amongst the accused, moved the High Court under Section 482, Cr.P.C. for quashing of the order of the Magistrate taking cognisance of the alleged offence and issuing summons. The High Court was persuaded to the view that this was a case to which Section 210(1) of CrPC, 1973 was attracted and that as an investigation by the police was in progress in relation to the same offence the learned Magistrate would be required to stay the proceedings on the complaint and call for a report in the matter from the police; and that the learned Magistrate acted without jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the offence and ordering issue of process against the accused. The High Court, accordingly, quashed the proceedings against the respondents.
From the orders under appeal it would appear that two grounds commended themselves for acceptance to the High Court. The first was that the learned Magistrate acted contrary to the provisions of Section 210. The High Court observed:
The investigation is still continuing and pending in so far as the petitioner is concerned and the investigation shall continue. Obviously the Judicial" Magistrate acted beyond ''jurisdiction in taking cognisance against the petitioner when for the same allegation the investigation was proceeding and pending. He acted contrary to the provisions of Section 210 of the CrPC. The complaint was filed after long delay....
The second ground was on the merits of the complaint. The High Court, inter alia, observed:
On the face of the complaint petition of the first information report itself the facts alleged do not constitute the offence. The petitioner was never named in the first information report. There is no eye witness in this case and there is no identification of the petitioner in any manner whatsoever to sustain the allegation even prima facie for the offence alleged.
4. On a careful consideration of the matter, we are afraid, the approach of and the conclusion reached by the High Court is unsupportable. In regard to the first ground, presumably, certain provisions of the "Act" in regard to cognizability and investigation of offences against the Act. relevant to the matter, had not been placed before the High Court. The policy and object of the Wild Life laws have a long history and are the result of an increasing awareness of the compelling need to restore the serious ecological-imbalances introduced by the depredations inflicted on nature by man. The state to which the ecological imbalances and the consequent environmental damage have reached is so alarming that unless immediate, determined and effective steps were taken, the damage might become irreversible. The preservation of the fauna and flora some species of which are getting extinct at an alarming rate, has been a great and urgent necessity for the survival of humanity and these laws reflect a last-ditch battle for the restoration, in part at least, a grave situation emerging from a long history of callous insensitiveness to the enormity of the risks to mankind that go with the deterioration of environment. The tragedy of the predicament of the civilised man is that "Every source from which man has increased his power on earth has been used to diminish the prospects of his successOrs. All his progress is being made at the expense of damage to the environment which he can not repair and cannot foresee." In his foreword to International Wild Life Law". H.R.H. Prince Philip. The Duck of Edinburgh said:
....Many people seem to think that the conservation of nature is simply a matter of being kind to animals and enjoying walks in the countryside. Sadly, perhaps, it is a great deal more complicated than that....
....As usual with all legal systems, the crucial requirement is for the terms of the conventions to be widely accepted and rapidly implemented. Regretfully progress in this direction is proving disastrously slow....
See International Wildlife Law by Simon Lyster. Cambridge - Grotuis Publications Limited. 1985 Edn.
There have been a series of international conventions for the preservation and protection of the environment. The United Nations General Assembly adopted on 29-10-1982. "The world charter for nature." The charter declares the "Aware" ness that:
(a) Mankind is a part of nature and life depends on the uninterrupted functioning of natural systems which ensure the supply of energy and nutrients.
(b) Civilization is rooted in nature, which has shaped human culture and influenced all artistic and scientific achievement, and living in harmony with nature gives man the best opportunities for the development of his creativity and for rest and recreation.
In the third century B.C. King Asoka issued a decree that "has a particularly contemporary' ring" in the matter of preservation of wild life and environment. Towards the end of his reign, he wrote:
Twenty six years after my coronation, I declared that the following animals were not to be killed; parrots, mynas. the aruna, ruddy geese, wild geese, the nandimukha, cranes, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, rhinoceroses...and all quadrupeds which are not useful or edible...forests must not be burned.
Environmentalists' conception of the ecological balance in nature is based on the fundamental concept that nature is "a series of complex biotic communities of which a man is an inter-dependant part" and that it should not be given to a part to trespass and diminish the whole. The largest single factor in the depletion of the wealth of animal life in nature has been the "civilized man" operating directly through excessive commercial hunting or. more disastrously, indirectly through invading or destroying natural habitats.
5. We might now turn to certain provisions of the Act. Section 9(1) of the Act says that no person shall "hunt" any wild animal specified in Schedule I. Elephant is included in schedule I. The expression "wild-animal" is defined in Section 2(36) to mean any "animal found wild in nature and includes any animal specified in schedule I" etc. The expression "hunting" is defined in Section 2(16) in a comprehensive manner:
2(16) "hunting' with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, includes.
(a) capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring and trapping of any wild animal and every attempt to do so.
(b) driving any wild animal for any of the purposes specified in Sub-clause (a),
(c) injuring or destroying or taking any part of the body of any such animal or, in the case of wild birds or reptiles, damaging the eggs of such birds or reptiles, or disturbing the eggs or nests of such birds or reptiles;
Section 51 of the Act provides for penalties. Violation of Section 9(1) is an offence under Section 51(1). Section 55 deals with cognizance of offences:
55. No court shall take cognizance of any offence against this Act except on the complaint of the Chief Wild Life Warden or such other officer as the State Government may authorise in this behalf.
What emerges from a perusal of these provisions is that cognizance of an offence against the "Act" can be taken by a Court only on the complaint of the officer mentioned in Section 55. The person who lodged complaint dated 23-6-86 claimed to be such an officer. In these circumstances even if the jurisdictional police purported to register a case for an alleged offence against the Act, Section 210(1) would not be attracted having regard to the position that cognizance of such an offence can only be taken on the complaint of the officer mentioned in that section. Even where a Magistrate takes cognisance of an offence instituted otherwise than on a police-report and an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to same offence, the two cases do not lose their separate identity. The section seeks to obviate the anomalies that might arise from taking cognisance of the same offence more than once. But, where, as here, cognisance can be taken only in one way and that on the complaint of a particular statutory functionary, there is no scope or. occasion for taking cognisance more than once and, accordingly, Section 210 has no role to play. The view taken by the High Court on the footing of Section 210 is unsupportable.
