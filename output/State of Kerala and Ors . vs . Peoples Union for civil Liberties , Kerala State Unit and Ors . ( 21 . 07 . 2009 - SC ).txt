*Case Note:
Constitution of India--Article 226--Doctrine of Colourable legislation--Judicial review--Once the statute is held to be within the legislative competence of the Legislature, it can be set aside only if it violates any of the provisions of Part III or other provisions of the Constitution--It cannot be struck down on the ground of colourable exercise of power or mala fide on the part of Legislature--Motive for legislation is beyond the scope of Judicial review under Article 226--Restriction on Transfer by and Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Act, 1999 (Kerala Act 12 of 1999).

Appellant/State challenged decision of the High Court of Kerala by which it declared certain provisions of Kerala Restriction on Transfer by and Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Act, 1999, void and unconstitutional. The Judgment proceeded on the basic premise that the statute was meant to neutralise an earlier decision of the High Court. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the High Court should not have struck down various provisions of the Act after finding that the Act is within legislative competence of the State Legislature. In the light of such a finding, an Act can be struck down only if it violates any of the provisions of part III or other provision of the Constitution. Apex Court further held that no motive can be attributed to the Legislature for enacting a statute and motive of the Legislature cannot be examined under Article 226. It was further held that violation of Article 14 would arise only where a person is divested of his vested right without paying compensation to him and since the Act provided for payment of compensation, it does not violate Article 14. Apex Court also held that if the latter statute completely wipes out the earlier statute, the first statute will not revive even if the second statute is struck down as unconstitutional. Allowing the appeal, the Court;

Held:

The High Court, in our opinion, again with utmost respect, has committed a fundamental error in failing to keep a distinction in mind in regard to the power of a law making authority which is of a qualified character and the power granted to a legislative authority which is absolutely without any limitation and restriction, being plenary in character. A statute in view of the decision of this Court in Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd.'s case (supra), in the event of it being held within the ambit of the legislative competence of the State, could be declared ultra vires only on the premise that it is violative of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India or any other provisions but not on the ground of colourable exercise of power or mala fide on the part of the Legislature. The object, purpose or design referred to by the High Court should be taken into consideration for the purpose of examining its constitutionality on the touchstone of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India and not otherwise. The question, in our opinion, should have been whether the statute is valid having been enacted to achieve the constitutional goal set out not only in Part III of the Constitution of India but also Part IV and IVA thereof. (Paragraph 12)

Constitution of India--Article 14--A person can be divested of the vested right acquired by him only after paying compensation to him--If such vested right has not been taken away, Article 14 is not infringed.

Held:

No territory in the State of Kerala has been declared as Scheduled Area within the meaning of Article 244 read with the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India. The decisions of this Court, therefore, are clear and unambiguous. In a case involving members of the Scheduled Tribe living in Scheduled Area the period of limitation can be extended, but it is not permissible in respect of an area which has not been declared to be a Scheduled Area. When a person acquires an indefeasible right, he can be deprived therefrom only by taking recourse to the doctrine of Eminent Domain. If a person is sought to be deprived of an indefeasible right acquired by him, he should be paid an amount of compensation. In a case of this nature, therefore, where an amount of compensation has not actually been tendered, the vendees of the land could not be deprived of their right to be dispossessed. In that view of the matter, a distinction must be made between a case where an amount of compensation has been paid and in a case where it has not been. If a vested right has not been taken away, the question of applicability of Article 14 of the Constitution of India would not arise. The High Court, however, proceeded to apply Article 14 of the Constitution of India on the premise that the provisions of the 1999 Act clearly seek to destroy the right conferred on Scheduled Area by Act 31 of 1975. The approach of the High Court being not correct, the same cannot be sustained. (Paragraph 15)

General Clauses Act, 1897 (Central Act 10 of 1897)-- Sections 6 & 7--Revival of earlier statute--If the latter statute completely wipes out the earlier statute, the first statute will not revive even if the second statute is struck down as unconstitutional.

Held:

Repeal of a statute, it is well-known, is not a matter of mere form but one of substance. It, however, depends upon the intention of the legislature. If by reason of a subsequent statute, the Legislature intended to abrogate or wipe off the former enactment, wholly or in part, then it would be a case of total or pro tanto repeal. If the intention was merely to modify the former enactment by engrafting an exception or granting an exemption, or by adding conditions, or by restricting, intercepting or suspending its operation, such modification would not amount to a repeal. In Southern Petrochemical Industries' case (supra), the subsequent Act did not contain the words "unless a different intention appears". It was held that the later Act was not different from the earlier Act. This Court is required to assume that the Legislature did so deliberately. (Paragraph 20)

LAND LAWS AND AGRICULTURAL TENANCIES
JUDGMENT
S.B. Sinha, J.
Issue
1. Effect of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus issued by a High Court directing implementation of an enactment vis-a-vis a subsequent legislation altering or modifying the right of the beneficiaries under the former Act, inter alia, is the question involved in these appeals.
2. They arise out of a judgment and order dated 24th August, 2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam.
Background Facts
3. The State of Kerala enacted the Kerala Scheduled Tribes (Restriction on Transfer of Lands and Restoration of Alienated Lands) Act, 1975 (Act No. 31 of 1975) (for short 'the 1975 Act') with the object of providing restriction on transfer of land by Members of Scheduled Tribes in the State of Kerala and for restoration of possession of lands alienated by such members and for matters connected therewith.
4. The said Act received the assent of the President of India. It was included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India, being item No. 150, by the Constitutional 40th Amendment Act. It was published in the Kerala Gazette Extraordinary on 14th November, 1975. However, only on 24th January, 1986 a Notification was issued bringing the said Act into force with retrospective effect from 1st January, 1982.
RULES UNDER THE SAID ACT
5. Kerala Scheduled Tribes (Restriction on Transfer of lands and Restoration of Alienated Land) Rules, 1986 (1986 Rules) were framed for effective implementation of the 1975 Act and were published in the Kerala Gazette Extraordinary on 18th October, 1986.
PROCEEDINGS
6. Members of the Scheduled Tribes filed applications for restoration of their lands in the year 1988 in terms of the provisions of the 1975 Act and the 1986 Rules.
7. As the said Act was not implemented in letter and spirit, one Dr. Nallathampy Thera filed a writ petition which was marked as O.P. No. 8879 of 1988 praying inter alia for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the State to implement the provisions of the Act and directing the concerned authorities to deal with and dispose of the applications filed therein. Before the High Court the learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the State submitted that:
utmost steps would be taken for the disposal of the applications and that the Act would be enforced in all its rigour.
8. Relying on or on the basis of the said statement, O.P. No. 8879 of 1988 was disposed of by the High Court on 15th October, 1993, inter alia, calling upon the State to give directions to the Authorities under the 1975 Act to dispose off the applications pending before them within 6 months from the said date.
9. The State, however, did not comply with the said directions within the said time frame. Extensions of time were sought for complying with the said directions. By the said process, a period of two years lapsed.
10. Another application for extension of time was filed for implementation of the Act and the High Court granted six months' time but issued certain directions inter alia for the purpose of monitoring the progress of the implementation of the Act.
11. The said conditions are as under:
(i) The State shall ensure that all the applications are disposed of within the extended time.
(ii) The State shall immediately communicate copies of this order to the Revenue Divisional Officers of all the Districts for compliance.
(iii) The Authorities under the Act, i.e., the Revenue Divisional Officers of the concerned Districts shall file affidavits before this Court once in a month showing the progress achieved in the disposal of applications during that month. The first of these affidavit showing the progress-made until 31.12.1995 shall be filed before 15.1.1996. The next of the affidavits showing progress till 31.1.1996 shall be filed before 15.2.1996 and so on.
(iv) The State shall provide the necessary back up and support to the Revenue Divisional Officers to complete the work within the extended time now granted.
(v) The State or any of the Revenue Divisional Officers shall be at liberty to approach this Court in the event of any difficulty being felt in disposing off the applications.
(vi) It is seen from the affidavit filed by the Government that the pendency of applications in the Districts of Palakkad, Wayanad, Idukki and Kottayam is unusually large. The Revenue Divisional Officers of these Districts are directed in particular to dispose of all the applications within the extended time.
12. Applications for restoration of lands which were pending were disposed of pursuant to the said directions. Appeals were filed in a few cases but in most of them the orders directing restoration of lands became final.
13. Strangely however, no actual restoration of land was effected. Another application was filed by the writ petitioner on 1st March, 1996 complaining about non-implementation of the said order.
14. The learned Additional Advocate General once again gave an assurance that the order of the authorities under the 1975 Act would be implemented. On or about 28th March, 1996 the High Court directed:
The learned Additional Advocate General assures the court that all out efforts will be made to dispose of all the pending applications within the time stipulated by this Court and further that wherever there has been final orders passed, actual restoration will also be formal orders are necessary today. Post on 31.5.1996.
15. Further affidavits were filed by the Revenue Divisional Officers reporting progress in the disposal of the applications made under the Act.
16. On or about 13th August, 1996 the High Court issued the following directions:
1) The Revenue Divisional Officers are directed to cause delivery of the properties covered by orders for restoration against which, no appeals are pending and in which no compensation is payable, forthwith and in any event within six weeks from today.
2) In view of the submission that the officers are meeting with resistance in restoring possession the State and the District Superintendents of Police of all Districts are directed to afford the needed protection to the Revenue Divisional Officers to carry out their duty of restoring possession to the Tribals.
3) The State and the Collectors of the various Districts are directed to make available to the Revenue Divisional Officers the necessary man power and support to carry out the implementation of the orders for restoration passed under the Act.
4) The Revenue Divisional Officers will file statements before this Court by 30.9.1996 reporting compliance with direction No. 1
17. An intra court appeal was preferred there against. The matter was referred to a Full Bench. An order of stay was passed relying on or on the basis of a statement made before the Court that amendments to the 1975 Act were proposed to be made.
18. However, as the President of India declined to give his assent to the Bill passed by the Legislature of the State of Kerala for amendment of the said Act, the order of stay was vacated.
19. The Full Bench on 21st May, 1998 passed the following order:
Heard learned Additional Advocate General, Mr. T. Mohammed Youseff and Mr. A.X. Varghese, Advocate. The above application is filed to extend the order of stay granted in the Writ Appeal for a further period of six months from 21.5.1998. This Court granted the interim order of stay since at the time the Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Kerala was pending consideration before the Hon'ble President of India. It is now stated in the affidavit that the Hon'ble President of India has declined assent to the Bill passed by the State Legislative Assembly. In the light of the Hon'ble President of India having declined assent to the Kerala Scheduled Tribe (Restriction on Transfer of Lands and Restoration of Alienated Lands) Amendment Act, 1996, there is no justification for this Court extending the order to stay granted earlier. The interim stay granted earlier is vacated.
2. The learned Single Judge, while disposing of C.M.P. No. 28950 of 1995 in O.P. 8879 of 1988, was pleased to grant time till 30.9.1996 for reporting compliance with direction No. 1 in the order. The time was extended from time to time for compliance with the directions till the order of stay was granted. Now that the order of stay having been vacated, we grant six months time to the State for carrying out the direction contained in the order of the learned single judge dated 13th August 1996, passed in C.M.P. No. 28950 of 1995, without prejudice to the right of the Government in considering the various aspects of the matter to bring forward suitable legislation with suitable changes, if they so desire.
(emphasis added)
20. On or about 23rd November, 1998 an application for initiating proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 was filed against the State and its officers on the premise that orders of the High Court had not been complied with. A notice was issued therein.
21. A petition was filed by the State for extension of the period by six months from 21st November, 1998. However, a statement was made before the Full Bench that a new Bill would be introduced before the Legislative Assembly in terms whereof a permanent solution to the problem of alienation of tribal lands which had taken place during the period from 1.1.1960 and 1.1.1986 shall be dealt with. The Full Bench, by its order dated 6th January, 1999, directed:
This petition has been filed by the State to extend the time (sic) granted already by a period of six months from 21.11.98. We have perused the affidavit and heard the arguments of both sides. We have also heard Dr. P. Nalla Thampy Thera. He opposed the petition for extension of time tooth and nail. This Court has already granted six month's time. The State has explained the reasons for its inability to introduce the new bill within the time granted earlier. We are satisfied with the reasons given in the affidavit. It is now stated in the affidavit that the Legislative Assembly is expected to commence its next session on 22.1.99 and that the new bill formulated by the Government will be introduced in this session. According to the Government, the new bill is expected to find a permanent solution to the problem of alienation of tribal lands which had taken for the period from 1.1.1960 to 1.1.1986. therefore, they pray that in the interest of justice the State may be granted extension of time to introduce the Bill in this session.
2. We have considered the rival submissions and are of the opinion that in the interest of justice, the time already granted has to be extended by three months from today. As already noticed, the Assembly session is to commence on 22.1.1999 and the State is proposing to introduce the Bill in this session.
3. In view of the above, the time already granted by this Court is hereby extended by three months from today. The State shall introduce the Bill in this session of the Assembly and complete all the other formalities within the time now granted. We make it clear that there will be no further extension of time. The State is directed to pay cost of this petition to Dr. Nail a Thampy Thera which is fixed at Rs. 5000/-, by way of demand draft drawn in his name, within three weeks from today."
(emphasis supplied)
WRIT PROCEEDINGS
22. Indisputably the Legislature of the State thereafter enacted the Kerala Restriction on Transfer by and Restoration of Lands to the Scheduled Tribes Act, 1999 (for short 'the 1999 Act'), which inter alia deals with transfer and alienation of agricultural lands.
23. Constitutional validity of the 1999 Act, specially the proviso appended to Section 5(1), Section 5(2), Section 6 and Section 22 were challenged by filing two writ petitions; one marked as O.P. No. 25332 of 1999 filed by Niyamvedi, respondent No. 1 in civil Appeal No. 105 of 2001 and another O.P. No. 26499 of 1999 by Peoples Union for civil Liberties, Kerala State Unit, respondent No. 1 in civil Appeal No. 104 of 2001.
24. In the aforesaid writ petitions counter-affidavits were filed on behalf of the Union of India supporting the stand of the tribes.
25. Malayora Karshaka Federation (appellant before us in C.A. No. 899 of 2001) was impleaded as a party therein. By reason of the impugned judgment and order dated 24th August, 2000, the High Court declared the aforesaid provisions as ultra vires.
FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT
26. The High Court, while acknowledging, the legislative intent of the State of Kerala, opined that it was colourable in nature as by reason of the provisions of the 1975 Act and the orders passed in favour of the members of the Scheduled Tribes, a vested right accrued to the members of Scheduled Tribes was destroyed by reason of the provisions of 1999 Act.
27. Proviso to Sections 5(1), Section 5(2), Section 6 and Section 22 of the 1999 Act were held to be arbitrary. The said provisions were also held to be discriminatory and thus violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The issue in regard to violation of Article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution of India was determined on the premise that no sufficient material had been placed before the Court.
28. Inter alia relying on or on the basis of the decision of this Court in Madan Mohan Pathak v. Union of India MANU/SC/0253/1978 : (1978)ILLJ406SC , the High Court held that in effect and substance, by reason of the provisions of the 1999 Act, a judicial decision was sought to be nullified.
29. The contention of the respondents that Presidential assent having not been obtained, the 1999 Act was violative of Article 254 of the Constitution of India was, however, rejected. With regard to compliance of the requirements of Article 338 of the Constitution of India, consultation with Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes Commission was held to be not imperative.
30. Section 22 of the 1999 Act was held to be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India, having regard to the accrued rights of the members of the Scheduled Tribes in view of the issuance of the writ of mandamus issued, the High Court directed:
In the light of our discussion as above, we declare the proviso to Section 5(1), Section 5(2), Section 6 and Section 22 of the Kerala Restriction on Transfer by and Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Act, 1999, Act 12 of 1999 as unconstitutional and void. We strike down the proviso to Section 5(1), Section 5(2), Section 6 and Section 22 of Act 12 of 1999. We direct the State and the Authorities under Act 31 of 1975 to implement the orders for restoration passed under the Kerala Scheduled Tribes (Restriction of Transfer of land and Restoration of Alienated Lands) Act, 1975, Act 31 of 1975 and restrain the State and the Authorities under Act 12 of 1999 from enforcing the proviso to Section 5(1), Section 5(2), Section 6 and Section 22 of Act 12 of 1999.
THE APPEALS BEFORE US
31. civil Appeal Nos. 104-105 of 2003 have been filed by the State of Kerala against the common judgment and order dated 24th August, 2000 passed by a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in O.P. Nos. 25332 and 26499 of 1999 filed by Niyamavedi and Peoples Union for civil Liberties, Kerala State Unit striking down the proviso to Section 5(1), Section 5(2), Section 6 and Section 22 of the 1999 Act.
32. civil Appeal No. 899 of 2001 has been filed by Malayora Karshaka Federation Kerala Meenangadi (respondent No. 7 before the High Court in O.P. No. 25332 of 1999) against the aforesaid order dated 24th August, 2000.
33. civil Appeal No. 7079 of 2001 has been filed by M. Mohan Kumar, Chief Secretary, Government of Kerala against the order dated 4th December, 2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court in C.C.C. No. 542 of 1986 whereby the Court directed the appellant to appear before it for framing charges against him in not complying with the final direction issued by the Court on 18th December, 1999.
CONTENTIONS
34. Mr. T.L. Viswanath Iyer, learned senior counsel and Mr. Dayan Kishnan, Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants would submit:
i) The High Court committed a manifest error in holding that the 1999 Act suffers from the vice of colourable exercise of power or is otherwise mala fide despite holding that the Legislature of the State of Kerala had the requisite legislative competence therefore.
ii) The members of the Scheduled Tribes had no fundamental or common law right to obtain restoration of possession of their lands which had already been alienated.
iii) Such a right having been conferred upon them by reason of the provisions of 1975 Act, the same could be taken away and/or modified or altered by reason of a subsequent Act which comes within Entry 18 of the List II of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.
iv) Only because non-agricultural lands had been kept out of purview of 1999 Act, the same by itself did not attract the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution of India..
v) The provisions of the 1999 Act being more beneficial compared to the provisions of 1975 Act, only because the tribes would be allotted lands outside their original habitants, the same would not attract Article 21 of the Constitution of India, particularly when they would be getting 2 hectares of land as also grant for payment of compensation to the land holder in stead and place of repayable amount of loan as provided for in the 1975 Act.
vi) Keeping in view the nature of mandamus issued by the High Court in the earlier round of litigation, it would not mean that the State was not precluded from amending or repealing the 1975 Act.
vii) The decision of this Court in Madan Mohan Pathak (supra) and Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0392/1983 : [1985]154ITR64(SC) having been explained in Indian Aluminium Co. v. State of Kerala MANU/SC/0370/1996 : [1996]2SCR23 as also a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Tamilnadu v. Arooran Sugars Ltd. MANU/SC/0426/1997 : AIR1997SC1815 , the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.
viii) The tribals in whose favour the orders of restoration had been passed having not filed any writ petition, it must be presumed that they were not aggrieved by the provisions of the 1999 Act, particularly in view of the fact that their association had been consulted by the Government Officials and in that view of the matter the writ petitioner - association had no locus standi to maintain the public interest litigation having regard to Baba Charan Pass Udhasi v. Mahant Basant Das Babaji Chela Baba Laxmandas Udasi Sadhu MANU/SC/0428/2000 : AIR2000SC2610 .
(x) In any event, a declaration by a Superior Court that a subsequent statute is ultra vires would not wipe off the earlier statute automatically.
(xi) The purchasers of land having acquired the properties in 1950s must be held to have acquired an indefeasible right over the same and thus the 1975 Act even to that extent was not applicable.
35. Mr. Rajinder Sachar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondents in C.A. Nos. 104-105 of 2001, on the other hand, would contend:
i) The 1999 Act being in the teeth of the mandamus issued by the High Court has rightly been held to be unconstitutional in view of the fact that nothing has been brought on record to show that the 1999 Act was enacted by the legislature despite knowledge that the directions issued by the High Court had attained finality.
ii) The 1975 Act having conferred a right of restoration on the Members of the Scheduled Tribes, both in respect of agricultural and non-agricultural lands, the provisions of 1999 Act and in particular Section 6 thereof having confined its operation only to agricultural land and that too with retrospective effect from 24th January, 1986, must be held to be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
iii) The Members of the Scheduled Tribes being mostly residents of forests and the lands restored in their favour being forest lands, no legal infirmity was committed by the High Court in holding that the tribals; the community being weakest of weak, should not be deprived therefrom having regard to their constitutional right of life as adumbrated in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
iv) As from the statistics furnished by the State itself it would appear that only about 10 percent of the applicants had more than 2 hectares of land, the right of restoration of the marginal farmers could not have been taken away.
v) Once a statutory protection is granted to the beneficiaries, the same could not have been withdrawn.
36. Mr. Verghese, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No. 1 in civil Appeal No. 899 of 2001 supplementing the arguments of Mr. Sachar urged:
i) That the Members of Scheduled Tribes having come under attack by economically more advanced and politically more powerful ethnic groups who infiltrated into tribal regions in search of land and new economic possibilities, keeping in view Article 46 of the Constitution of India, they were entitled to restoration of land in terms of the judgment of the High Court passed in O.P. No. 8879 of 1988.
ii) Provisions of 1975 Act having been found to be constitutionally valid, the accrued and vested rights of the tribals could not have been taken away by reason of 1999 Act or otherwise.
iii) The Writ-Petitioner - association having been fighting for the cause of the tribals for a long time, it cannot be said that they had no locus standi to file the public interest litigation.
iv) Even the Union of India having supported the case of the tribals, there is no reason as to why this Court should interfere with the impugned judgment.
v) The 1999 Act being not a validating statute, the impugned judgment is unassailable, particularly having regard to the objective of 1975 Act vis-a-vis 1999 Act.
vi) It is incorrect to contend that the State before enactment of 1999 Act consulted the true representatives of the tribals.
vii) In any view of the matter as the members of the tribal community became entitled to restoration of their land by reason of the provisions of the 1975 Act, there was no reason as to why the original land would not be restored to them.

Every proceedings pending before a Court on a complaint under Section 14 of the said Act shall be deemed as a proceeding under the corresponding provisions of this Act and shall be continued accordingly.
CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF 1999 ACT
LEGISLATIVE BACKDROP
60. The validity of 1975 Act is not in question. It, having regard to its inclusion in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India by Constitution 40th Amendment Act, 1976 read with Article 31B which precludes an attack to the provisions of such an enactment on the ground that it violates any provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India, the validity thereof was upheld by a leaned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court in Bhavani v. State of Kerala 1989 (1) KLT 37.
61. We may also notice that Jagannadha Rao, C.J. (as His Lordship then was) in Fr. Thomas Kubukkat v. Union of India 1994 (2) KLT 25 also upheld the provisions of Section 1(3) of 1975 Act stating the said provision to be conditional legislation and not a delegated legislation.
62. The Constitutional validity of statutes enacted for the benefit of the members of Scheduled Tribe by some other State although not identical has been upheld by this Court in Manchegowda and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. MANU/SC/0342/1984 : [1984]3SCR502 , Lingappa v. State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0236/1984 : [1985]2SCR224 ; P. Rama Reddy v. State of A.P. MANU/SC/0364/1988 : AIR1988SC1626 and Samtha v. State of Andhra Pradesh MANU/SC/1325/1997 : AIR1997SC3297 ].
62. These decisions have been rendered on statutes which are not absolutely identical. All of which are not in pari materia with the other.
63. However, we may notice that in Manchegowda (supra) this Court held:
19. We have earlier noticed that the title which is acquired by a transferee in the granted lands, transferred in contravention of the prohibition against the transfer of the granted lands, is a voidable title which in law is liable to be defeated through appropriate action and possession of such granted lands transferred in breach of the condition of prohibition could be recovered by the grantor. The right or property which a transferee acquires in the granted lands, is a defeasible right and the transferee renders himself liable to lose his right or property at the instance of the grantor. We have further observed that' by the enactment of this Act and particularly Section 4 and Section 5 thereof, the Legislature is seeking to defeat the defeasible right of the transferee in such lands without the process of a prolonged legal action with a view to speedy resumption of such granted lands for distribution thereof to the original grantee or their legal representatives and in their absence to other members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes communities. In our opinion, this kind of defeasible right of the transferee in the granted lands cannot be considered to be property as contemplated in Articles 31 and 31A. The nature of the right of the transferee in the granted lands on transfer of such lands in breach of the condition of prohibition relating to such transfer, the object of such grant and the terms thereof, also the law governing such grants and the object and the scheme of the present Act enacted for the benefit of the weaker sections of our community, clearly go to indicate that there is in this case no deprivation of such right or property as may attract the provisions of Articles 31 and 31A of the Constitution.
64. We are not concerned with the constitutional validity of 1975 Act. We would at an appropriate stage deal with the matter in regard to the effect thereof.
COLOURABLE LEGISLATION
65. We have noticed hereinbefore that the Division Bench of the High Court has upheld the legislative competence of the Legislature of the State of Kerala. We, therefore, really at pains to understand as to how the doctrine of 'Colourable Legislation' could be invoked by the learned Judge of the High Court.
66. The doctrine of 'Colourable Legislation" is directly connected with the legislative competence of the State. Whereas the 1975 Act was enacted in terms of Entry 6 List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India providing for transfer of lands; the 1999 Act was enacted in terms of Entry 18 List II thereof. It reads as under:
18. Land, that is to say, right in or over land, land tenures, including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land ; land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization.
67. The 1999 Act, thus, having confined itself to 'agricultural land', indisputably the State Legislature only has the requisite legislative competence therefore.
68. It is one thing to say that an enactment suffers from vice of colourable legislation on the premise that it does not have legislative competence but it is another thing to say that only because the Act was amended purporting to nullify an earlier Act (in the words of the High Court), the same by itself would attract the said doctrine.
69. For invoking the doctrine of 'Colourable Legislation' the legislature must have transgressed the limits of its constitutional power patently, manifestly and directly.
70. The doctrine of 'Colourable Legislation', in our opinion, has no application in the instant case. The said doctrine is founded on legislative competence of the State. An act of mala fide on the part of the legislature also is beyond the province of judicial review. In fact no motive can be attributed to the Legislature for enacting a particular statute. The question in regard to the constitutionality of the statute must be considered keeping in view only the provisions of the Constitution.
71. In K.C. Gajapathi Narayan Deo v. The State of Orissa MANU/SC/0014/1953 : [1954]1SCR1 , this Court held:
9. It may be made clear at the outset that the doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve any question of bona fides or mala fides on the part of the legislature. The whole doctrine resolves itself into the question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular law. If the legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the motives which impelled it to act are really irrelevant. On the other hand, if the legislature lacks competency, the question of motive does not arise at all. Whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a question of power.
