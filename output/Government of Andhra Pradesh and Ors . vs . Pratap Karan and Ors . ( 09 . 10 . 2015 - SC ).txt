Facts:

The Plaintiffs (the Respondents) filed Title Suit for rectification of Revenue Records by incorporating their names as owners and possessors in respect of the suit land by deleting the duplicate Survey no. in respect of portion of the land of the said Village.

The contesting Plaintiff-Respondents filed the above suit stating that their predecessor in title late Raja Shivraj Dharmavanth Bahadur (late Raja) was the pattadar and absolute owner of the suit schedule property. On the death of late Raja issueless in the year 1917, the succession of his estate was granted by the Royal Firman in favour of the sons of his two brothers Raja Lokchan Chand and Raja Murali Manohar Bahadur by another Royal Firman, the succession of estate of late Raja Dhiraj Karan was granted in the name of Pratap Karan who is one of the Plaintiffs. The other Plaintiffs are the successors of legal heirs of Raja Dharam Karan, Raja Mehboob Karan and Raja Manohar Raj.

It has been contended on behalf of the Plaintiff-Respondents that they are, therefore, the absolute owners and possessors of the suit schedule land. The present survey number 613 was shown as the corresponding old Survey Number 579 without any change in the extent of the land. However, as per the endorsement made in the Khasra Pahani (1954-55) there is a remark that the lands of late Raja are shown in separate series and in the Pahanies subsequent to the Khasra, S. No. 613 is shown as Shivaraj Bahadur Ilaka without determining the extent. It is the Plaintiff's case that in certified copies of the pahanies for the years 1955-01, there is duplication of S. No. 119.

The Plaintiffs who are successors in interest of the land made attempts for correction of the entries in the Revenue Records under A.P. Record of Right in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971 (the Act) and the authorities rejected the claim for correction of entries on the ground that unless the Plaintiffs get their title declared in a court of law, the mutation in the name of the Plaintiffs cannot be effected Under Section 8(2) of the Act. The Defendants have no title over the suit schedule land.

The trial court, on consideration of evidence came to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs have not made out a case for correction of Revenue Record and dismissed the suit. Aggrieved by the same, the Plaintiffs filed the appeal before the High Court, which being allowed by one Judge and dismissed by another Judge, was heard by a third Judge, who after considering the law laid down by the High Court as well as this Court, held that the Plaintiffs successfully demonstrated that late Raja was pattadar/khatadar of the land covered by S. No. 613, the presumption backward/forward can be applied in his favour and in favour of his heirs that he or they continued to be the pattadar(s). Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the Defendant-Appellants have preferred this appeal.

Several interlocutory applications were filed by Appellants during the pendency of this appeal. By I.A. No. 9/2015, the Appellant stated that during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court, Respondent No. 12 died but the legal representatives have not been substituted by the Respondents, who were Appellants before the High Court which resulted in abatement of the said appeal. By another I.A. Nos. 10 and 11 of 2015, the Appellant has stated that during pendency of this appeal Respondent No. 6 died on 8.4.2015 and Respondent No. 14 died on 6.1.2014 which were not within the knowledge of the Appellant, hence prayer has been made to set aside the abatement and substitute their legal representatives.

Held, while dismissing the appeals

1.In the instant case, the Plaintiffs joined together and filed the suit for rectification of the revenue record by incorporating their names as the owners and possessors in respect of the suit land on the ground inter alia that after the death of their predecessor-in-title, who was admittedly the Pattadar and Khatadar, the Plaintiffs succeeded the estate as sharers being the sons of Khatadar. Indisputably, therefore, all the Plaintiffs had equal shares in the suit property left by their predecessors. Hence, in the event of death of any of the Plaintiffs, the estate is fully and substantially represented by the other sharers as owners of the suit property. We are, therefore, of the view that by reason of non-substitution of the legal representative(s) of the deceased Plaintiffs, who died during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court, entire appeal shall not stand abated. Remaining sharers, having definite shares in the estate of the deceased, shall be entitled to proceed with the appeal without the appeal having been abated. We, therefore, do not find any reason to agree with the submission made by the learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants.[38]

2.A comparative study of Section 98 Code of Civil Procedure vis-à-vis Clause 36 of the Amended Letters Patent of the Andhra Pradesh High Court will reveal that while Section 98 provides that in a case where the Judges comprising the Bench differ in opinion on point of law, they may state the point of law upon which they differ and the appeal shall be heard upon that point only by one or more of the other Judges, such point shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority of the Judges. Whereas Clause 36 of the amended Letters Patent provides that in a case the Division Court exercising its original or appellate jurisdiction hears the appeal and the Judges are divided in opinion as to the decision to be given on any point, such point shall be decided according to the opinion of majority of Judges. If the Judges are equally divided they shall state the point upon which they differ and the case shall then be heard on that point by one or more of the Judges and the point shall be decided according to the opinion of majority of Judges who have heard the case including those who first heard it.[49]

3.Coming back to the instant case, the two learned Judges of the Division Bench passed separate judgments. One of the learned Judges allowed the appeal and set aside the trial court judgment, whereas another learned Judge affirmed the trial court finding and dismissed the appeal. Both the learned Judges differed not only on the point of facts but also on the point of law. The learned Chief Justice, therefore, referred the matter to the third Judge for deciding the appeal. The learned third Judge, after going through the judgments of the learned differing Judges, formulated various issues and recorded its finding on all the points. The learned third Judge finally upheld the finding recorded by one of the learned differing Judges and allowed the appeal. In our considered opinion, therefore, there has been complete compliance of Clause 36 of the Letters Patent of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the impugned judgment cannot be vitiated on that account.[54]

4.One of the Judges of the Division Bench after considering the facts of the case and discussing elaborately the oral and documentary evidence recorded a finding with regard to the title in respect of S. No. 613 in favour of the Plaintiffs. The third Judge in the impugned judgment has also discussed the evidence and finally upheld the finding recorded by one of the Judges of the Division Bench. We do not find any reason to differ with the finding recorded by the two judges of the High Court on the issue of title of the Plaintiffs predecessors over the suit land.[77]

5.The learned Judge of the High Court in the impugned judgment has taken judicial notice of the fact that the Government, now-a-days is claiming property by rounding off the names of Pattadars and Ors. in the Revenue Records without referring to any proceedings, which fact has also been observed in a Division Bench judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Syed Ahmad HasanBoth the trial court and the learned Judge of the Division Bench, who affirmed the finding of the trial Court have failed to take into consideration the relevant provision of the Hyderabad (Abolition of Jagirs) Regulation, 1358 Fasli and held that by the said Regulation, all Jagir land became the Government land. It is clear that such land which has been brought under survey settlement and record of right has been prepared in the name of the land owner in respect of self cultivated land shall have no effect on the provisions of Jagir Abolition Regulations.[81],[82] and[83]

6.The Trial Court erroneously held that except entries made in Sethwar and Wasool Baqui, there are no subsequent Revenue entries much less consistent entries to corroborate the entries in Sethwar and Wasool Baqui to establish title. The Trial Court recorded incorrect finding that the subsequent Revenue entries do not contain the name of Raja Shivraj Bahadur either pattadar/khatadar and in all the records instead of his name the land was either shown as Kancha-Sarkari or land confiscated by the government. The Trial Court further erroneously held that even in the khasra-pahani of the year 1954-55 which is an important Revenue Record, the name of Raja Shivraj Bahadur was not shown as khatadar/pattadar.[85]

7.Considering all the documentary evidences together viz., Exh. P-2 Firman confirming the successor of Late Raja Dhiraj Karan in favour of Pratap Karan, one of the Plaintiffs, Exh. P-5 Sethwar for Survey No. 613, Exh. P-8 Vasool Baqui, substantiate the case of the Plaintiff-Respondents that the Revenue Records were not correctly and properly maintained. Further, the Touch Plan copies of Survey No. 613 and 119 and certified copies of Pahani in respect of the suit land show the incorrect maintenance of Revenue Records. There is no explanation or evidence from the side of the Appellants as to under which proceeding and by which order the Revenue Record was changed. So far as the claim of confiscation of the land by the Government is concerned no proceeding was initiated by any competent authority under any law before making entries in the Revenue Records that land was confiscated. For doing the same there must be a proceeding and order of confiscation of the land which has not been brought on record.[89]

8.Further, there is no document to show that in pursuance of confiscation entries the person in occupation was dispossessed and the record is maintained showing dispossession and taking possession of the land by the Government. In the survey settlement proceedings there cannot be duplication in survey numbers. We have failed to understand as to how a duplicate Survey No. 119 came into existence and the land of Survey No. 613 was shown in that duplicate survey No. 119. The learned District Judge while deciding the injunction application has recorded admission of the Government that the Plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land. On the basis of admission by the Appellant and the Revenue Record the Court gave interim protection by granting a temporary injunction in favour of the Plaintiffs.[89]

9.One of the learned Judges of the Division Bench on consideration of all the documentary evidence and the Revenue Records recorded the finding in favour of the Plaintiff. The said finding of the learned judges has been affirmed and upheld by the learned third Judge of the High Court and allowed the appeal and set aside the finding of the Trial Court. We have given our thoughtful consideration on the finding recorded by the learned Judges of the Division Bench and finding recorded by the third learned Judge to whom the matter was referred for passing the final judgment. In our view, there is no material on the record to reverse the finding of the two learned Judges of the High Court.[91] and[92]

10.For the aforesaid reasons, we find no merit in C.A. No. 2963 of 2013 and the same is dismissed. So far as Civil Appeal No. 2964 of 2013 filed by the Appellant-Corporation is concerned, admittedly the Appellant-State, despite pendency of appeal in the High Court, transferred the suit land in favour of the Corporation. The said transfer is not only hit by lis pendens but also appears to be not bonafide. Be that as it may, consequent upon the dismissal of the appeal of the State being C.A. No. 2963 of 2013, the appeal being C.A. No. 2964 of 2013 filed by the Corporation is also dismissed.[93] and[94]

JUDGMENT
M.Y. Eqbal, J.
1. This appeal being C.A. No. 2963 of 2013 arises out of the judgment and order dated 19.12.2011 passed by the 3rd Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh to whom the matter was referred to by the Chief Justice for final decision against the conflicting judgments passed by the two judges of the said High Court. The appeal was preferred by the Plaintiff-Respondent before the High Court which was heard by a Division Bench. The two judges of the Division Bench delivered two conflicting judgments, one by allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the trial court and the other by dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment of the trial court. The 3rd Judge to whom the matter was referred, passed the impugned judgment upholding the judgment of one of the learned judges and allowing the appeal and decreeing the suit of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Another appeal being C.A. No. 2964 of 2013 has been filed by the transferee of the suit property during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court. Since leave was granted, both the appeals have been heard and disposed of by this judgment.
2. The Plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents) filed Title Suit No. 274 of 2007 for rectification of Revenue Records by incorporating their names as owners and possessors in respect of the suit land comprised within Survey No. 613 of Nadergul Village, Saroornagar Mandal, Rangareddy District, by deleting the duplicate Sy. No. 119 in respect of portion of the land of the said Village.
3. The factual matrix of the case is that the contesting Plaintiff-Respondents filed the above suit stating that their predecessor in title late Raja Shivraj Dharmavanth Bahadur (hereinafter referred to as "late Raja") was the pattadar and absolute owner of the suit schedule property. The succession of the estate of late Raja was declared by a Royal Firman of the Nizam in favour of Raja Dhiraj Karan, late Raja Dharam Karan, late Raja Mehboob Karan and the heirs of Raja Manohar Raj vide Firman dated 4th Ramzan 1359 Hizri (Ex. A1). On the death of late Raja issueless in the year 1917, the succession of his estate was granted by the Royal Firman in favour of the sons of his two brothers Raja Lokchan Chand and Raja Murali Manohar Bahadur by another Royal Firman dated 5th Safar 13 1361 Hizri, the succession of estate of late Raja Dhiraj Karan was granted in the name of Pratap Karan who is one of the Plaintiffs, under Ex. A2. The other Plaintiffs are the successors of legal heirs of Raja Dharam Karan, Raja Mehboob Karan and Raja Manohar Raj.
4. It has been contended on behalf of the Plaintiff-Respondents that they are, therefore, the absolute owners and possessors of the suit schedule land. The land in Nadergul Village was subject matter of survey and settlement of the year 1326 Fasli (year 1917) and under the said survey and settlement the lands of late Raja were part of Khata No. 1 wherein the suit schedule land was having Survey Number 579. Late Raja's name was also shown as Khatadar in Setwar and Vasul Baqui. Thus, the suit lands are private lands of late Raja. The revisional survey of Nadergul Village was given effect in the year 1352 Fasli (year 1943) and the said survey has also confirmed the ownership of late Raja in Khata No. 3 (Khata No. 1 as per survey of 1326 Fasli (year 1917) which also made it clear that the suit lands are private lands of late Raja. The present survey number 613 was shown as the corresponding old Survey Number 579 without any change in the extent of the land.
5. The Respondent's further case is that the certified copy of Setwar and Vasul Baqui relating to Sy. No. 613 for the year 1352 Fasli (year 1943) clearly disclose that late Raja was the Khatadar of all the land in Sy. No. 613 of Nadergul Village, Saroornagar Mandal, Rangareddy District, Ex. A5. The village map of Nadergul Village and plan of S. No. 613 clearly disclose the land as 'Kancha' of Late Raja. The total survey numbers in the village are about 875. As per the village map and the corresponding land records i.e., Setwar, Vasool Baqui, Touch Plan and Pahanies, the land within the boundaries of S. No. 119 consists of an extent of Ac. 1-20 guntas, which is in the name of Gaddam Mallaiah as Khatadar. However, as per the endorsement made in the Khasra Pahani (1954-55) there is a remark that the lands of late Raja are shown in separate series and in the Pahanies subsequent to the Khasra, S. No. 613 is shown as Shivaraj Bahadur Ilaka without determining the extent.
6. It is the Plaintiffs' case that as per the certified copies of pahanies for the years 1949-50 and 2000-01 the land in S. No. 613 of Nadergul Village stood in the name of late Raja. However, it is alleged that in the Khasra Pahani, S. No. 613 is rounded up, which does not convey any meaning. After 1954-55, Revenue Records are showing the land in S. No. 119 with an extent of Ac. 355-12 guntas and it is not known as to how the original extent of land in S. No. 119 shown as Ac. 1-20 has swollen to Ac. 355-12 guntas with endorsement of "Sarkari" from the original endorsement of Gaddam Mallaiah, which clearly discloses duplication of the land in S. No. 119 and to say the least, the Revenue Record has been tampered with by the custodians of the records with an oblique motive of depriving the legitimate owners of the land in S. No. 613 of Nadergul Village. Even today, pahanies, village maps, and touch plan clearly disclose the existence of S. No. 613 with a large chunk of land but purposefully the revenue authorities are not disclosing the details of the ownership of the suit land. The basic record i.e., Setwar and Vasul Baqui Register of 1352 Fasli (year 1943). The endorsement in the Khasra Pahani of 1954-55 that the lands of late Raja in S. No. 613 are being shown separately, is devoid of a sensible meaning. As per the endorsement, it is incumbent on the Defendants to continue to maintain the revenue records in the name of late Raja and the Plaintiffs being the predecessors in interest as pattadar/khatadar of the said land in S. No. 613 of Nadergul Village.
7. The Plaintiffs' case is that in certified copies of the pahanies for the years 1955-01, there is duplication of S. No. 119, and while Gaddam Mallaiah is shown as Khatadar of S. No. 119 in respect of land admeasuring Ac. 1-20 guntas, the duplicated S. No. 119 admeasuring more than 355 acres and sometimes Ac. 373-22 guntas is being shown as Kancha Sarkari notwithstanding the fact that in the Khasra Pahani for the year 1954-55 it is clearly mentioned late Raja as khatadar/pattadar of the entire land in S. No. 119. Since the Khasra Pahani has confirmed the ownership of late Raja, the same cannot be changed as Sarkari Kancha in the Pahani without there being any proceedings. When the land in S. No. 613 is continuing to exist as per the village maps and touch plan, the pahanies and other records are being maintained with mis-description, by which title of the real owner will not vanish. The Plaintiffs who are successors in interest of the land made attempts for correction of the entries in the Revenue Records under A.P. Record of Right in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971 (for short "the Act") and the authorities rejected the claim for correction of entries on the ground that unless the Plaintiffs get their title declared in a court of law, the mutation in the name of the Plaintiffs cannot be effected Under Section 8(2) of the Act. The Defendants have no title over the suit schedule land.
8. The 5th Defendant-Appellant Mandal Revenue Officer, Saroornagar, while denying the suit claim, contended that the suit is not maintainable. According to him, the Plaintiffs are neither owners nor possessors of the suit schedule property and they are in no way concerned with the suit land as per the Revenue Records. It has been pleaded on behalf of the Defendants that the Plaintiffs did not obtain succession certificate from the competent civil court and have not acquired the suit property of late Raja through succession as pleaded.
9. In the amended written statement, it has been pleaded by the Defendant that Nadergul was a Jagir Village and as all the jagirs were abolished under the Hyderabad Abolition of Jagirs Regulation, all Jagir properties vested in the State and the Jagirdars became entitled only to receive compensation amount and the estate of late Raja also got merged with the State and all Jagirs in Hyderabad State were taken over by the Government and transferred to Deewani after publication of Notification No. 8 dated 07-04-1949. Further Nazim Atiyat had passed an order dated 20-01-1958 in File No. 1/56 Warangal/1950 and the legal heirs of Late Raja had participated in the said proceedings and staked claim for commutation amount in respect of the Jagir land. Aggrieved by the said proceedings, some of the Plaintiffs and certain other successors of late Raja had filed appeal before the Board of Revenue and the same was dismissed vide order dated 24.07.92 and a review petition was also dismissed by the Board of Revenue and, thereafter, the same persons had filed W.P. No. 4999 of 1974 in the High Court and as per the judgment in the said writ petition, dated 22.04.76, the matter was remanded back to the Board of Revenue and after remand, the appeals filed by the above said persons were dismissed for non-prosecution.
10. It has been further pleaded in the aforesaid amended written statement that after abolition of Jagirs, the Jagir lands of late Raja numbering about 8 survey numbers were rounded off and separate numbers from 1 to 194 were given as evidenced in the Khasra Pahani for the year 1954-55 and as such the contention of the Plaintiffs that original Sy. No. 119 admeasuring Ac. 1-20 guntas in the name of Gaddam Mallaiah has increased to 355 acres is not only false but the same is contrary to the record. Sy. No. 119 admeasuring Ac. 1-20 guntas is separate and distinct survey number from the Sy. No. 119 which finds place in the Khasra Pahani in separate series of 1 to 194. This Sy. No. 119 is admeasuring Ac. 355.00 and recorded as Sarkari Poramboke. Having not filed any declarations under the Land Ceiling Laws, the Plaintiffs are not entitled to stake the suit claim. It is further pleaded by the Defendant that the Plaintiffs and their ancestors have participated in the enquiry before Nazim Atiyat for the award of commutation amount and hence they are estopped from filing the present suit, that too after lapse of about 5 decades.
11. The trial court, on consideration of evidence came to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs have not made out a case for correction of Revenue Record and dismissed the suit. Aggrieved by the same, the Plaintiffs filed the appeal before the High Court, which being allowed by one Judge and dismissed by another Judge, was heard by a third Judge, who after considering the law laid down by the High Court as well as this Court, held that the Plaintiffs successfully demonstrated that late Raja was pattadar/khatadar of the land covered by S. No. 613 admeasuring 373-22 guntas in the Khasra Pahani, the presumption backward/forward can be applied in his favour and in favour of his heirs that he or they continued to be the pattadar(s). Allowing the appeal of the Plaintiffs and setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial court, the learned third Judge of the High Court observed, thus:
Unless the State proves that the said land has been confiscated or vest in the State under Jagir Abolition Act on abolition of jagirs or for non filing of the declaration, the property vest in the Government under the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings), 1973, mere mentioning "Sarkari" in subsequent pahanies or giving duplication S. No. 119, title of the original owner will not vanish and it continues to be vest with them. In Khasra Pahani for the year 1954-55 covered under Ex. 12(a), when it is stated that S. No. 613 has been recorded as "Self Cultivation Dastagardan" and numbers of the Sivaraj Bahadur has been written separately and the same has also been shown as S. No. 119 under Ex. 12(b). Therefore, late Raja or his heirs continue(s) to be pattadar(s) for the corresponding survey number and on changing also, but the same cannot become the government property as contended by the learned Advocate General. Further, the identity of land in S. No. 613, suit land, as found in Ex. A-10-touch plan and Ex. A-9-village map cannot undergo any change whatsoever and ownership may change from one person to the other but the location of land and its identity with reference to survey number cannot be changed. Therefore, there is no further necessity for the Plaintiffs to seek declaration of their title except to seek correction of record of rights recording the names of the heirs of late Raja i.e. the Plaintiffs. Thus, the Plaintiffs are entitled for a declaration for correction of the entries in the record of rights recording the names of the legal heirs of late Raja and also injunction restraining the Defendants from interfering with the Plaintiffs peaceful possession.
12. Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the Defendants-Appellants have preferred this appeal.
13. We have heard learned senior Counsel appearing for the parties and also perused the written submissions filed by them.
14. While raising an additional ground for the first time here in this appeal, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General appearing for the Appellants, submitted that the learned judges of the Division Bench who heard the appeal differed vertically in as much as Section 98(2) of Code of Civil Procedure provides for confirmation of decree of the trial court. Reference to the 3rd Judge was made in the present case not after formulating any points of disagreement on the question of law, hence the reference by the Chief Justice to the learned 3rd Judge is ultra vires. In this connection learned Counsel referred the decision of this Court in Tej Kumar v. Kirpal Singh MANU/SC/0321/1995 : (1995) 5 SCC 119. It was further submitted that even if the provisions of Letters Patent Act are invoked the same cannot override the provisions of Section 98 Code of Civil Procedure. In this connection learned Counsel referred decisions in P.V. Hemalatha v. Kattamkandi Puthiya Maliackal Saheeda MANU/SC/0501/2002 : (2002) 5 SCC 548 and Centre For Environmental Law v. Union of India MANU/SC/1262/2010 : (2010) 12 SCC 303. It was further contended that even if Clause 36 of the Letters Patent of the Madras High Court which has been adopted for the A.P. High Court is held applicable, nonetheless, in the present case, since no points of agreement have at all been formulated for consideration by the two learned judges who had heard the appeal, reference to the 3rd judge was, therefore, clearly incompetent.
15. Learned Attorney General appearing for the Appellant raised another point with regard to abatement of the appeal pending before the High Court on the ground inter alia that one of the Respondents i.e., Respondent No. 12 died on 21.12.2010 during the pendency of the appeal before the High Court. Since the prayer made in the suit is the one for declaration of title of the Plaintiffs as a single entity the appeal pending in the High Court itself stands abated. Further, the appeal in the High Court got abated as a whole in as much as the decree that was challenged before the High Court was a joint and indivisible decree. In this connection the Appellants relied upon the decision in the case of MANU/SC/3384/2006 : (2006) 6 SCC 569 and MANU/SC/0565/2010 : (2010) 11 SCC 476.
16. On merit of the appeal, the Appellants first assailed the finding and the conclusion arrived at by the High Court that the area by name Bhagat Nadegul of Hyderabad District is different from Nadergul Village. According to the Appellant there is absolutely no material to show that there is any other village by the name Nadergul in any part of the State. In this connection learned Counsel referred the evidence of PW-1.
17. Further, the contention of the Appellants is that the predecessors of the Plaintiffs had sought for commutation in respect of land in Nadergul Village will show that the said lands were treated as Jagir land. The findings of the Atiyat Court qua Nadergul with the relevant Sandas have not been produced for verification. There is no finding anywhere in Exh. B.1 that Nadergul is not a Jagir Village. Merely because commutation amount was not awarded in respect of Nadergul Village, it shall not be treated as a private land. It was submitted that none of the Plaintiffs entered the witness box and testified on any of the averments made in the plaint and the only person examined was PW-1 as General Power of Attorney holder of the Plaintiffs who could not have any personal knowledge on the issues relating to the grant made by Nizam and the proceeding relating thereto.
18. On the relevancy of documentary evidence learned Counsel contended that Sethwar (Exh. A-5), Register of Vasool Baqui and Khasra Pahani in respect of Survey No. 613 are not sufficient to declare title of Raja Shiv Bahadur and, thereafter, the Plaintiffs as successors to the Estate in respect of the suit property. Learned Counsel contended that it is inconceivable that fairly large extent of 373.22 acres of private land would otherwise not be subjected to any land revenue. According to the Appellants since the land of Survey No. 613 was a Crown's land it was not assessed to land revenue. With regard to Pahani Patrika from 1949-50 till 2000-01 shows that the land in survey No. 613 as Kancha-Sarkari or Kancha-Shiv Raj Bahadur. It was contended that there is no document whatsoever to support the case of the Plaintiffs with regard to the title to the suit property. These documents cannot be treated as document of title of the Plaintiffs.
19. Lastly, the submissions of the Appellants is assuming that without admitting that there has been duplication of survey numbers is accepted that by itself cannot enable the Plaintiffs to get a declaration of title unless there is prima facie evidence of title being acquired by their predecessors in interest. In any view of the matter the suit itself is barred by limitation.
20. Mr. Dushyant A. Dave, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant Corporation in Civil Appeal No. 2964 of 2013, also made his submission on behalf of the Corporation and contended that none of the Plaintiffs have entered in the witness box and the only witness who was examined was the Plaintiff's GPA holder whose evidence cannot be taken into consideration. Mr. Dave contended that the Plaintiffs have kept quiet for more than 50 years and hence the suit claim is a chance litigation. It was further contended that the judgment of the 3rd learned Judge is opposed to Section 98(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure and suggested that the matter will have to be remanded to the High Court.
21. Per contra, Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Plaintiffs-Respondents, at the very outset submitted that although A.P. Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited to whom the suit property was illegally transferred by the Appellant-State during the pendency of appeal in High Court is neither a necessary party nor have got any right to prefer appeal against the impugned judgment passed by the High Court.
22. On the issue of application of Section 98(2) of Code of Civil Procedure, Dr. Singhvi, learned senior Counsel, submitted that A.P. High Court is governed by the Letters Patent of Madras High Court and, therefore, Section 98(2) of the Code has no application by reason of Section 98(3) of the Code. It is submitted that the decision of this Court relied upon by both the parties on this point itself clarify that Section 98(2) of the Code has no application to the High Court which is governed by Letters Patent. In this connection learned Counsel also referred the decision of Patna High Court in MANU/BH/0089/1984 : AIR 1984 Patna 296 and MANU/BH/0029/1979 : AIR 1979 Patna 115. Learned Counsel therefore submitted that there is no illegality in the reference made by the Chief Justice to the 3rd Judge of the High Court for deciding the appeal.
23. Rebutting the submission made by the Appellants on the question of abatement learned Counsel submitted that the present suit is for declaration of title and permanent injunction. On the death if Defendant No. 12 the right to sue survives with the remaining Plaintiffs and, therefore, that the appeal then pending in the High Court will not abate. Learned Counsel referred Order 22 Rule 2 Code of Civil Procedure and submitted that the objection with regard to abatement of appeal in the High Court was neither raised before the High Court nor raised in the grounds of memo of appeal filed before this Court.
24. Replying the submissions made by Mr. Dave, appearing for the Appellant Corporation in another appeal, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Respondents submitted that a GPA holder can give evidence on matters which are within his knowledge and he is competent enough to give evidence on behalf of the party. In this connection he relied upon MANU/SC/1030/2004 : AIR 2005 SC 439.
25. Further submissions on behalf of the respective Respondents have been made by Mr. Vikas Singh and Mr. Harin P. Raval, learned senior Counsel, that since there is no dispute on the genuineness and authenticity of documentary evidence on record, the suit claim has to be decided on documentary evidence i.e. Exhs. A1-A-19. According to the learned senior Counsel Exh. A-5 (Sethwar), Exh. A-6 (Vasool Baqui Record), Exh. A-12 (Khasra Pahani) shows that the name of Shiv Raj Bahadur was recorded as the Pattadar of the suit land. From these documents it can be inferred without any doubt that ruler of the kingdom has accepted the ownership of Shiv Raj Bahadur and there is no need to have either Patta or title documents.
26. Referring to the admission in written statement filed by the Defendant-Appellants it was submitted that there are various other Pattadar in Nadergul Village. Further there is no pleading in the written statement that Shiv Raj Bahadur was a Jagirdar of the suit land. It was further contended that in the order passed in Nizam Atiyat proceeding it was declared that some villages are not Jagir lands. The declaration by Nizam Atiyat is for the whole village and not for some survey numbers in the Village. Admittedly, there are various other Pattadars in Nadergul Village and, therefore, in the Nizam Atiyat proceeding Nadergul was shown in List-3 as patta lands.
27. So far as the issue with regard to the suit, being barred by limitation it was submitted by the Respondents that the suit for declaration of title and injunction falls Under Article 65 of the Limitation Act 1963 where limitation is 12 years from the date when possession of the Defendant become adverse to that of the Plaintiff. There is no pleading in the written statement that the State has obtained title by adverse possession. In the present case the Defendant-State has never set up and or cannot set up title by adverse possession, hence the suit cannot be held to be barred by limitation. There is no evidence adduced from the side of the Defendants that the State ever came in possession. On the contrary the possession of the Plaintiff-Respondents was sufficiently proved by the trial court while deciding the injunction petition as also in the finding recorded by the High Court dismissing the appeal against the order of injunction.
28. We have heard learned senior Counsel appearing for the parties at length and perused the record.
29. Before we decide the merit of the appeal, we shall take up the interlocutory applications filed by the Appellant during the pendency of this appeal. By I.A. No. 9/2015 filed on 20th July, 2015, the Appellant stated that during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court, Respondent No. 12 died but the legal representatives have not been substituted by the Respondents, who were Appellants before the High Court which resulted in abatement of the said appeal. Hence, prayer has been made that non-substitution of legal representatives of Respondent No. 12 in the appeal pending in the High Court, the appeal stood abated by operation of law and consequently judgment and decree passed by the High Court in the appeal suit No. 274 of 2007 is rendered nullity in law.
30. By another I.A. Nos. 10 and 11 of 2015, the Appellant has stated that during pendency of this appeal Respondent No. 6 died on 8.4.2015 and Respondent No. 14 died on 6.1.2014 which were not within the knowledge of the Appellant, hence prayer has been made to set aside the abatement and substitute their legal representatives.
31. Learned Attorney General appearing for the Appellant pressed these two applications relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Matindu Prakash (Deceased) by L.Rs. v. Bachan Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0011/1976 : AIR 1977 SC 2029; Amba Bai and Ors. v. Gopal and Ors. MANU/SC/0286/2001 : (2001) 5 SCC 570; Budh Ram and Ors. v. Bansi and Ors. MANU/SC/0565/2010 : (2010) Vol. 11 SCC 476.
32. In the case of Matindu Prakash (Deceased) by L.Rs. v. Bachan Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0011/1976 : AIR 1977 SC 2029, when the appeal was pending in this Court, it revealed that two of the Appellants died and no step was taken to bring the heirs and legal representatives of those Appellants on the record. The question, therefore, that fell for consideration was whether appeal abated as a whole so as to entail a dismissal of the entire suit. This Court, therefore, remitted the matter back to the High Court to record a finding and to decide whether by virtue of the death, the appeal abated as a whole or the appeal had abated qua the deceased Appellants before the Civil Appeal is disposed of.
33. In the case of Amba Bai and Ors. v. Gopal and Ors. MANU/SC/0286/2001 : 2001 (5) SCC 570, this Court was considering the case where a suit for specific performance by one Plaintiff against the Defendant was finally allowed in appeal and the suit was decreed. During the pendency of Second Appeal by the Defendant in the High Court, the Plaintiff died and his legal representatives were brought on record. Subsequently, the Defendant also died, but this fact was not brought to the notice of the Court and the appeal was dismissed. In those facts this Court considering the provision of Order 22 Rule 3 of the Code held that "in a case where the Plaintiff or the Defendant dies and the right to sue does not survive, and consequently the Second Appeal had abated and the decree attained finality inasmuch as there cannot be merger of the judgment or decree passed in Second Appeal with that passed in the First Appeal." The said decision therefore, in our considered opinion will not apply in the present case. In the instant case, there are more Plaintiffs than one and one of them died and the right to sue survives upon the surviving Plaintiffs. In the said circumstances Order 22 Rule 2 of the Code will come into operation and the appeal will not abate.
34. In the case of Budh Ram and Ors. v. Bansi and Ors. MANU/SC/0565/2010 : (2010) 11 SCC 476, this Court after considering series of judgments rendered by this Court in the State of Punjab v. Nathu Ram (MANU/SC/0019/1961 : AIR 1962) SC 89, Sri Chand v. Jagdish Pershad Kishan Chand MANU/SC/0008/1966 : AIR 1966 SC 1427, Ramagya Prasad Gupta v. Murli Prasad MANU/SC/0008/1972 : (1973) 2 SCC 9 and Sardar Amarjit Singh Kalra v. Pramod Gupta (2003) 3 SCC 72 held as under:
17. Therefore, the law on the issue stands crystalised to the effect that as to whether non-substitution of L.Rs. of the Respondent-Defendants would abate the appeal in toto or only qua the deceased Respondent-Defendants, depends upon the facts and circumstances of an individual case. Where each one of the parties has an independent and distinct right of his own, not interdependent upon one or the other, nor the parties have conflicting interests inter se, the appeal may abate only qua the deceased Respondent. However, in case, there is a possibility that the court may pass a decree contradictory to the decree in favour of the deceased party, the appeal would abate in toto for the simple reason that the appeal is a continuity of suit and the law does not permit two contradictory decrees on the same subject-matter in the same suit. Thus, whether the judgment/decree passed in the proceedings vis-à-vis remaining parties would suffer the vice of being a contradictory or inconsistent decree is the relevant test.
