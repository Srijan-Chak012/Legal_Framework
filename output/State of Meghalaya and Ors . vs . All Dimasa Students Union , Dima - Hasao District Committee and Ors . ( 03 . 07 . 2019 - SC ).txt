Case Note:
Environment - Coal mining - Ban thereto - Section 14 of National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 - Application was filed in National Green Tribunal (NGT) in respect of unregulated coal mining in Tribal areas of State - Tribunal after considering report of Committee and other materials on record directed ban on mining activated in State and came to conclusion that State had failed to perform its duties to act on recommendation of report of State Pollution Control Board - Tribunal opined that interim amount be deposited towards restoration of environment - Hence, present appeal - Whether blanket ban on mining activities imposed in State and deposit of interim amount towards restoration of environment was sustainable.

Facts:

The application had been filed in National Green Tribunal (NGT) with regard to unregulated coal mining in the Tribal areas of State. Tribunal passed an order directing the Chief Secretary, Director General of Police, State to ensure that rat-hole mining/illegal mining was stopped forthwith throughout the State and any illegal transport of coal shall not take place until further orders passed by the Tribunal. The Tribunal further directed that ban on rat hole mining shall continue subject to further orders of this Court. The Tribunal after considering the report of the committee and other materials on record came to the conclusion that the State had failed to perform its duties to act on the recommendation of the report of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board. The Tribunal opined that interim amount be deposited towards restoration of the environment.

Held, while partly allowing the appeal:

(i) The applicant clearly made out allegations which were sufficient for the Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction as conferred by Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Both the component as appearing in Sub-section 1 of Section 14 that was substantial question relating to environment and such question arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I, were present.

(ii) The allegations of the Applicant of environmental degradation by illegal and unregulated coal mining were fully proved from materials on the record including the report of the experts, report of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board, the report of Katakey committee, which all proved environmental degradation of water, air and surface.

(iii) The stand taken on behalf of the State of Meghalaya before this Court that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction could not be approved. The State Government was under constitutional obligation to ensure clean environment to all its citizens. In cases pertaining to environmental matter, the State had to act as facilitator and not as obstructionist.

(iv) According to the land tenure system as applicable in the Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya, the most of the lands were either privately or community owned in which State does not claim any right. The private owners of the land as well as community owners had both the surface right as well as sub-soil rights.

(v) Para 12A Sub-clause (b) of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution empowers that the President may, with respect to any Act of Parliament, by notification, direct that it shall not apply to an autonomous district or an autonomous region in the State of Meghalaya, or shall apply to such district or region or any part thereof subject to such exceptions or modifications as he may specify in the notification. No notification had been issued by the President under Section 12A(b). There was nothing in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which may indicate about the inapplicability of Act, 1957 with regard to the Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya.

(vi) There was nothing in Section 4(1) of 1957 Act to indicate that restriction contained in Section 4(1) of Act did not apply with regard to privately owned/community owned land in Hills Districts of Meghalaya. Further, word any area under Section 4(1) of Act also had significance which did not have any exception. Further phrase except under and in accordance with terms and condition with a mining lease granted under the Act were also significant which make the intent and purpose of prohibition clear and loud.

(vii) The statutory scheme delineated by Section 13(2)(f) and the Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1960 clearly contemplate grant of mining lease, with regard to both the categories of land, i.e., land in which minerals vest in the Government, and the land in which minerals vest in a person other than the Government.

(viii) The Mines Act, 1952 contains various provisions regarding inspection of mining operation and management of mines. The provisions of The Mines Act, 1952 were mandatory to be followed before working a mine. The regulations namely Coal Mines Regulations, 2017 also contains several regulatory provisions which need to be followed while working a mine by a mining lease holder. The enforcement of Mines Act, 1952 and the Regulations, 2017 had to be ensured by the State in the public interest.

(ix) As per statutory regime brought in force by notification issued under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, environmental clearance was required for a project of coal for mining of any extent of area. While implementing statutory regime for carrying mining operations in the Hills Districts of the State of Meghalaya, the State of Meghalaya had to ensure compliance of not only MMDR Act, 1957 but Mines Act, 1952 as well as Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

(x) In Hill District of State of Meghalaya for carrying coal mining operations in privately owned/community owned land it was not the State Government which shall grant the mining lease under Chapter V of Rules, 1960, but it was the private owner/community owner of the land, who was also the owner of the mineral, who shall grant lease for mining of coal as per provisions of Chapter V of Rules, 1960 after obtaining previous approval of the Central Government through the State Government.

(xi) The State of Meghalaya had ample power and jurisdiction under the Act, 1957 and Rules, 1960 to check, control and prohibit coal mining operations in Hill Districts of State of Meghalaya.

(xii) The Union having made declaration by Section 2 of 1957 Act taking under its control Regulation and development of mineral, the power of Autonomous District Council to legislate on the subject shall also be denuded as that of the State Legislature.

(xiii) In event the mining is carried out by a mining lease holder as per the provisions of Act, 1957 and Rules, 1960 with an approved mining plan there can be no objections in carrying of such mining operations under the Regulation and control of the State of Meghalaya. In event mining operations are undertaken in privately owned/community owned land in Hills Districts of Meghalaya in accordance with mining lease with approved mining plan as per Act, 1957 and Mineral Concessions Rule, 1960, the ban order of the tribunal of the NGT shall not come in way of carrying mining operations.

(xiv) Under Order 26 Rule 10A of the Civil Procedure Code, a Court can appoint commission for scientific investigation. The power which could be exercised by a Court under Order 26 Rule 10A of Code of Civil Procedure ould very well be exercised by the NGT also. The NGT while asking expert to give a report was not confined to the four corners of Rule 10A and its jurisdiction is not shackled by strict terms of Order 21 Rule 10A by virtue of 19(1) of the NGT Act.

(xv) Rule 24 of National Green Tribunal (Practice and Procedure) Rules, 2011 empowers the Tribunal to make such orders or give such directions as may be necessary or expedient to give effect to its order or to secure the ends of justice. The power given to the Tribunal was coupled with duty to exercise such powers for achieving the objects. There was no lack of jurisdiction in NGT in directing for appointment of a committee and to obtain a report from a Committee.

(xvi) The direction to constitute a fund namely Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund, was also saved under the above power.

(xvii) NGT by directing for constitution of committee had not delegated essential judicial functions. The Tribunal had kept complete control on all steps which were required to be taken by the committees and has issued directions from time to time. The State was always at liberty to obtain appropriate directions if aggrieved by any act of the committee. The matter being pending before the Tribunal all acts of the committee are under direct control of the Tribunal and if the committee oversteps in any direction the same can very well be corrected by the Tribunal on the matter being brought before it.

(xviii) NGT by issuing direction to constitute the committee for transportation of the extracting mineral, for preparing time bound action plan to deal with the restoration of environment and to ensure its implementation did not in any manner interfere with the powers of the District or Regional Councils. The District and Regional Councils are free to exercise all their powers and committee constituted by the Tribunal is only concerned with the Environmental degradation and illegal coal mining. The committees report or direction of the Tribunal in no manner encroaches upon the administration of Tribal areas by the District and Regional Councils.

(xix) The amount which had been directed by NGT to be deposited by State was neither a penalty nor a fine imposed on the State. State had very limited source of finances and putting an extra burden on the State to make payment from its own financial resources may cause great hardship to the State. Ends of justice be served in modifying the direction of NGT to the extent that State was permitted to transfer an amount from the amount lying in the MEPRF to the Central Pollution Control Board. The Central Pollution Control Board as directed by the Tribunal shall utilize the said amount only for restoration of the environment in the State. [191]

JUDGMENT
Ashok Bhushan, J.
1. Natural resources of the country are not meant to be consumed only by the present generation of men or women of the region where natural resources are deposited. These treasures of nature are for all generations to come and for intelligent use of the entire country. The present generation owes a duty to preserve and conserve the natural resources of the nation so that it may be used in the best interest of coming generations as well and for the country as a whole.
2. These appeals have been filed challenging various orders passed by National Green Tribunal wherein several directions were issued, measures to be taken to check and combat the unregulated coal mining in Tribal areas of State of Meghalaya which coal mining resulted not only loss of lives but damaged the environment of the area.
Details of appeals
3. Civil Appeal Nos. 10720 of 2018, 10611 of 2018 and 10907 of 2018 have been filed against order dated 31.08.2018 passed by the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi. Civil Appeal No. 5272 of 2016 has been filed by KA Hima Nongstoin Land Owners, Coal Traders and Producers Association against the order dated 10.05.2016 of the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi. Civil Appeal (Diary No. 3067) of 2018 has been filed by Lber Laloo against order dated 25.03.2015 of National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi and Civil Appeal No. 2968 of 2019 has been filed against order dated 04.01.2019 of National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi by which State of Meghalaya has been directed to deposit Rs. 100 crores with the Central Pollution Control Board.
4. All the appeals having been filed against the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT), it is necessary to notice the details of various proceedings before the NGT to appreciate the grievances raised in the appeals. The Gauhati High Court on the basis of a News item to the effect that on 06.07.2012, 30 coal labourers were trapped inside a coal mine at Nongalbibra in the District of South Garo Hill and 15 of them died inside the coal mine, registered PIL suo moto No. (SH) 3 of 2012. Vide order dated 10.12.2012 of the Gauhati High Court the matter was directed to be transferred to NGT in which notice was issued by the Tribunal on 30.01.2013. Transferred matter was registered as Original Application NO. 11(THC)/2012. All Dimasa Students Union Dima Hasao District Committee filed an Original Application No. 73 of 2014 before National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench making serious complaints with regard to rat-hole mining operation, which has been going on in Jaintia Hills in the State of Meghalaya for last many years without being regulated by any law. It was alleged that in the course of rat-hole coal mining by flooding water several employees and workers have died. The Applicant had also brought before the Tribunal a detailed report of one Dr. O.P. Singh, Professor, Department of Environmental Studies, North-Eastern Hills University, Shillong, Meghalaya where entire aspects of the coal mining in the State of Meghalaya were discussed. The NGT admitted the application and took the view that illegal and unscientific mining neither can be held to be in the interest of people of the area, the people working in the mines nor in the interest of environment. After hearing applicant, the Tribunal on 17.04.2014 passed an order directing the Chief Secretary of Meghalaya, Director General of Police, State of Meghalaya to ensure that rat-hole mining/illegal mining is stopped forthwith throughout the State of Meghalaya and any illegal transport of coal shall not take place until further orders passed by the Tribunal. After the passing of the order dated 17.04.2014 various applications were filed before the Tribunal by different Associations and persons claiming interest in the subject matter of the application. Application No. 317/2019 was filed by Western Coal Miners and Exporters Association for being impleaded in O.A. No. 73 of 2014, which was allowed. Another application M.A. No. 306 of 2014 was filed by Khasi Hills District Autonomous District Council, Shillong, East Khasi Hills District, Meghalaya (one of the Appellants before us) for impleadment claiming to be a constitutional body and entitled in the sharing primarily of the royalty on the coal produced/mined, which application was allowed.
5. The Tribunal clubbed O.A. No. 13 of 2014, O.A. No. 73 of 2014 and O.A. No. 11(THC)/2012. Miscellaneous applications were filed before the Tribunal praying for vacating the order dated 17.04.2014. Against order dated 17.04.2014, C.A. No. 5756 of 2014 was filed by a coal mine owner. The miscellaneous application was also filed by the State Coordination Committee of the Jaintia Hills District, Meghalaya (one of the Appellants before us) for their impleadment, which was allowed. This Court dismissed the Civil Appeal filed against the order dated 17.04.2014 passed by the Tribunal, however, granted liberty to the Appellant to approach the Tribunal for modification of the order. The Tribunal also noticed in its order dated 09.06.2014 that there has been serious air, water and environmental pollution being caused by the illegal, unregulated and indiscriminate rat-hole mining being carried on in various parts of the State of Meghalaya. Serious pollution to the upstream was also noticed. The Tribunal, however, noticed that there are documents on record to show that right from the year 2003, there has been serious air and water pollution in the mining areas of Meghalaya which is injurious and has not only resulted in degradation of environment, particularly the streams and underground water, but has also seriously jeopardised the human health. It was further noticed that Transportation of coal in an illegal, unregulated, indiscriminate and unscientific manner has resulted in serious diseases to the people. The report of the Committee dated 09.06.2014 was noticed by the Tribunal. By order dated 09.06.2014 while permitting the transportation of the already extracted coal lying in open near the mining sites, constituted a committee for supervising such transportation. Various other directions were issued to the committee as well as to the State and its authorities.
6. By a subsequent order dated 01.08.2014 the Tribunal noticed that the committee earlier constituted by order dated 09.06.2014 failed to perform the functions assigned to it, hence, a new committee was constituted. The Tribunal from time to time issued various directions. We need to notice four orders passed by the Tribunal in detail which are subject matter of challenge in these appeals. The orders which are subject matter in these appeals are orders dated 25.03.2015, 10.05.2016, 31.08.2018 and 04.01.2019.
Order dated 25.03.2015
7. In order dated 25.03.2015 NGT noticed that the rampant, illegal, unscientific and life-threatening mining activity, particularly rat hole mining is going on in the State of Meghalaya for years. The NGT noticed the report of Commissioner appointed by it and opined that in spite of order dated 17.04.2014 fresh mining was going on. The Tribunal also noticed that State of Meghalaya has promulgated a Mining Policy of 2012 which does not deal with rat hole mining. The State Government was also directed to formulate and declare Mining Policy and Guidelines for the State of Meghalaya to deal with all aspects of mining, which Policy was yet to see the light of the day. The Tribunal also noticed that the order of the Tribunal has been violated by illegal mining despite complete prohibitory orders. It was noticed that the State Government has found as many as 73 cases of illegal transportation of coal in one District. Further, 15 more cases of specific violation of the NGT orders had already been registered by the State Government. In all 11 Districts of State of Meghalaya, 308 cases of violation have been registered and a total number of 605 trucks and 2675.63 tonnes of coal has been seized. The stand of the State for a non-compliance and its inability to comply with the direction was also noticed to the following effect:
(a) Lack of forces of carry out counter insurgency operations and implementation of NGT orders.
(b) The State Government proposes to approach the Central Government for claiming an exemption, in terms of para 12A(b) of the VIth Schedule of the Constitution of India and from the condition of previous approval of the Central Government under the Mine and Mineral Rule Regulation Act, 1957 in respect of reconnaissance, prospecting and mining of coal and from the operations of Coal Mines Nationalisation Act.
8. The Tribunal issued directions that the Additional Secretary, North East in the Ministry of Home, Central Government shall, within a period of two weeks, hold a meeting with the Chief Secretary of the State of Meghalaya and other concerned Authorities and consider the proposal of the State of Meghalaya. The Tribunal also expressed its disapproval for the conduct of the State in not formulating appropriate Policy and Guidelines. The Tribunal further observed that the mining in the State cannot be permitted, unless appropriate policy is prepared by the State Government.
9. The Tribunal also noticed that there is huge environmental degradation and pollution of the water in the State of Meghalaya and observed that serious steps are required to be taken for cleaning polluted waterbodies, with the above objective the Tribunal authorised the State Government to collect 10% on the market value of the coal in addition to the royally payable to it. In this regard following directions were issued:
It is also undisputable that there has been huge environmental degradation and pollution of the waterbody in the State of Meghalaya, because of this illegal, unscientific mining. No one has even thought of restoration of the area in question, to bring to some extent, if not completely, restoration of ecology and environment in question. Serious steps are required to be taken for cleaning polluted waterbodies and ensure that no further pollution is caused by this activity and the activity which would be permitted to be carried on finally including transportation of coal. On the basis of 'Polluter Pay Principle'. We direct that the State Government shall in addition to the royalty payable to it, shall also collect 10% on the market value of the coal for every consignment. Having heard the learned Counsel appearing for the parties and keeping in view the notifications of the Central Government dated 10.05.2012 and that of the State Government dated 22.06.2012, we may notice that in the report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the period ending 31st March, 2013 under 7.5.18 of Chapter 7 of which the invoice value of the coal has been taken Rs. 4850/- per metric tonne.
Thus, we direct that the State Government shall in addition to the royalty payable to it, also collect 10% of the said market value of the coal per metric tonne from each person. The amount so collected shall be deposited in the account to be titled as 'Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund' to be maintained by the State under the direct control of the Chief Secretary of the State of Meghalaya.
This amount shall only be used for restoration of environment and for necessary remedial and preventive measures in regard to environment and matters related thereto.
10. Certain other directions were issued by the Tribunal vide order dated 25.03.2015.
Order dated 10.05.2016
11. Order dated 10.05.2016 has been challenged by KA Hima Nongstoin Land Owners, Coal Traders and Producers Association. The NGT vide its order dated 23.12.2015 had permitted transportation of coal for the period till 15.05.2016. By order dated 31.03.2016, NGT refused to further extend the time for transportation and directed that after 15.05.2016 all extracted coal shall vest in the State. Aggrieved against order dated 31.03.2016 KA Hima Nongstoin Land Owners, Coal Traders and Producers Association filed C.A. No. 4793 of 2016 before this Court, which was disposed of by granting liberty to the Appellant to file application before the NGT. Pursuant to the liberty granted by this Court M.A. No. 427 of 2016 was filed before the NGT. By order dated 10.05.2016 applications, M.A. Nos. 400 and 427 of 2016 were dismissed. By the same order the State of Meghalaya was directed to place on record the exact current quantity of coal and value thereof including the status of the coal lying and mined anywhere in the State of Meghalaya as on 01.04.2015 and the exact quantity of coal lying as on 16.05.2016. The state was also directed to submit its proposal as to how the State shall deal with the coal that is vested in the State primarily for the reasons that entire coal is illegally extracted coal.
Order dated 31.08.2018
12. On 31.08.2018, the Tribunal noticing the earlier proceedings also noted that few issues are pending before this Court arising out of orders passed by the Tribunal. In paragraph 10 of the order following has been noticed:
10. At this stage, we may note that following issues are pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court arising out of orders passed by this Tribunal:
i) Civil Appeal No(s). 5272/2016 titled as Ka Hima Nongstoin Land Owners, Coal Traders and Producers Association Vs. All Dimasa Students Union, Dima Hasao District Committee and Ors., wherein following order was passed on 21.09.2016:
Having heard counsel for the parties, it is directed that the Petitioners, as well as the Respondents, who have mined the coal, are permitted to transport the coal on payment of royalty and other fees as fixed by the National Green Tribunal (for short, 'the Tribunal') and other relevant status. The extracted coal can be transported from 1st October, 2016 till 31st May, 2017. It is further directed that no other extraction shall take place in the meantime.
The finding of the Tribunal that the coal is vested in the State on the ground that it is illegally extracted coal, shall be adverted to at the time of final hearing. The miners shall keep the accounts and if, ultimately, it is held that the coal belongs to the State, they will refund the amount with interest. The quantum of interest shall be determined at the time of final hearing. Needless to say, these observations have been made without prejudice to the contentions to be raised by the learned Counsel for the parties. The tribunal can proceed with regard to the other aspects which are pending before it.
The above order shows that question whether coal is vested in the State is to be gone into before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
Thereafter, on 28.03.2018, by the said order, time for transporting already extracted coal was extended up to 31.05.2018 but it was clear that no further extraction shall be allowed.
ii) Civil Appeal Diary No. 3067/2018 titled as Lber Laloo Vs. All Dimasa Students Union, Dima Hasao District Committee and Ors., raising the question whether ban on mining can be continued. We are informed that in the said matter, the issue of mining plan has also been raised.
13. The Tribunal further directed that ban on rat hole mining shall continue subject to further orders of this Court. Ban on transportation of extracted coal will also continue subject to further orders. Following directions were issued in paragraph 13:
13. Accordingly, we direct that orders of ban of rat-hole mining will continue, subject to further orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Ban of transportation of the already mined material will also continue subject to further orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The State of Meghalaya will be the receiver/custodian of the available extracted coal as on date, subject to further orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. If any further coal not so far recorded in the inventory is available, a separate inventory may be made and if it is found that the extraction was illegal, royalty in terms of orders already passed may also be collected. This may be determined by the Secretary of Mining of the State of Meghalaya. While one view is that there is extracted coal and not accounted for, the other view put forward that it is result of illegal mining. This aspect may be gone into by the Secretary of Mining, State of Meghalaya in the first instance. The same be cross-checked by a joint team of representatives of Central Pollution Control Board and Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad.
14. The Tribunal also deliberated on restoration of the environment and rehabilitation of the victims for which funds were available. The Tribunal constituted a committee headed by Justice B.P. Katakey, Former Judge of the Gauhati High Court with representatives from Central Pollution Control Board and Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad. Paragraphs 14 to 28 of the order are relevant in this context which are as follows:
14. Only last question which remains is of restoration of the environment and rehabilitation of the victims for which funds are available. We are of the view that for this task, it will appropriate that we constitute an independent Committee. This Committee will be headed by Justice B.P. Katakey, Former Judge of the Guwahati High Court with representatives from Central Pollution Control Board and Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad.
15. The Committee will take the following steps:
• Take stock of all actions taken so far in this regard.
• Prepare time bound action plan to deal with the issue and ensure its implementation.
16. The Committee may requisition services of such technical experts as may be necessary and may also carry out visits to sites whenever necessary.

28. The Committee will be at liberty to take technical assistance from any quarter which may be facilitated by the State of Meghalaya. The Committee may also supervise any issue arising out of receivership/custodianship of the already extracted coal, including any environmental issues which any arise out of storage of the extracted material and the steps required to be taken for the purpose.
The Report of the Committee may be furnished to this Tribunal by e-mail at filing.ngt@gmail.com.
A copy of this order may be sent to all the concerned authorities by e-mail for compliance.
All pending matters will stand disposed of in above terms.
List for consideration of the Report on 06th March, 2019.
Order dated 04.01.2019
15. Justice Katakey submitted its report before the Tribunal on 02.01.2019. Committee's various proceedings which were part of the report were noticed in detail by the NGT. In paragraph 21 of the order following was noticed:
21. Under issue number D, it was noted that the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board in its report in September, 1997 had noted that unplanned and unscientific coal mining activities were taking place. This had achieved dangerous dimensions in the last two decades creating ecological disturbance and adverse environmental impacts. This showed that though cognizance of the problem was taken in the year 1997, the problem continues even 20 years thereafter. The State Pollution Control Board had, in the year 1997, recommended steps to check illegal mining including generation of awareness, legislative measures, use of technology, carrying out of study but none of the recommendations were implemented even after 21 years.
16. The Tribunal after considering the report of the committee and other materials on record came to the conclusion that the State of Meghalaya had failed to perform its duties to act on the recommendation of the report of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board submitted in the year 1997. The Tribunal opined that interim amount be deposited towards restoration of the environment. Paragraphs 31 to 33 are as follows:
31. Paying capacity and the amount which may act as deterrent to prevent further damage is also well recognised. Net Present Value of the ecological services foregone and cost of damage to environment and pristine ecology, the cost of illegal mined material, and the cost of mitigation and restoration are also relevant factors. The Committee may go into these aspects to determine the final figure.
32. We are satisfied that having regard to the totality of factual situation emerging from the record, damages required to be recovered are not, prima facie, less than Rs. 100 Crores. Accordingly, by way of an interim measure, we require the State of Meghalaya to deposit Rs. 100 crores within two months with the CPCB in this regard.
33. We have already noted the extent of damage found and the value of the illegally mined material, apart from clandestine mining for which sufficient material is not available. The State had collected, as noted in the earlier order, royalty of Rs. 400 crores which by now must be higher figure.
17. The State of Meghalaya has filed two appeals being C.A. No. 10720 of 2018 and C.A. No. 2968 of 2019. C.A. No. 10720 of 2018 has been filed questioning the order dated 31.08.2018 passed by the Tribunal by which the Tribunal directed that order of the ban of rat-hole mining will continue and further constituted Justice B.P. Katakey committee to take steps for restoration of the environment and rehabilitation of the victims. The other Civil Appeal No. 2968 of 2019 has been filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh questioning the order dated 04.01.2019 by which State of Meghalaya was directed to deposit interim amount of Rs. 100 crores towards restoration of the environment.
18. Against the same order dated 31.08.2018 two other appeals have been filed being C.A. No. 10611 of 2018 by the State Coordination Committee of Coal Owners, Miners and Dealers Forum and C.A. No. 10907 of 2018 by Garo Hills Autonomous District Council aggrieved by the perpetual ban of coal mining by order dated 31.08.2018 without considering illegality of the ban in the first place. The Appellants are also aggrieved by appointment of State Government receiver/custodian of the extracted coal when there is no dispute of the ownership of the coal and further the question of vesting of the coal in the State is pending consideration in this Court in C.A. No. 5272 of 2016.
19. C.A. No. 10907 of 2018 is filed by Garo Hills Autonomous District Council which is aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal dated 31.08.2018 by which it has confirmed the ban on coal mining which was in force for over four years and further direction by the Tribunal to constitute a committee for the disposal of funds in excess of Rs. 400 crores. The Appellants are aggrieved by the above and alleged that the Tribunal failed to consider that constituting the committee without considering the roles and responsibilities of the District Council has the effect of virtually excluding the Council from issues concerning administration of forests and lands which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Council. The ban on coal mining has effectively closed the doors on a major source of revenue for the functioning of the District Council, which is empowered in terms of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution to collect taxes.
20. C.A. No. 5272 of 2016 by KA Hima Nongstoin Land Owners, Coal Traders and Producers Association has been filed against order dated 10.05.2016 by which Miscellaneous Applications No. 400 and 420 of 2016 were dismissed. The Appellants had prayed for modification and clarification and/or recall of the final order dated 31.03.2016 by which Tribunal directed for vesting of the duly assessed already extracted coal with the State of Meghalaya and refusing to extend the time for transportation of the already extracted coal. The Appellants claim for propriety rights of its members over such coal, which were mined as per prevailing custom prior to 17.04.2014.
21. Now, remains appeal being Civil Appeal of 2019(@ Diary No. 3067 of 2018) filed on behalf of the Lber Laloo. The Appellant has filed this appeal against the order dated 25.03.2015. Aggrieved by the blanket ban on mining activities imposed in the State of Meghalaya by the NGT which, according to the Appellant, is adversely affecting the lives and livelihood of the miners in the State of Meghalaya. As a result of ban on coal mining large number of the families are affected in the State of Meghalaya, who are dependent for their livelihood on coal mining.
Submissions
22. We have heard Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel, Shri Amrendra Sharan, learned senior counsel, Shri Amit Kumar, Advocate General, for the State of Meghalaya. We also heard Shri Ranjan Mukherjee appearing for the State of Meghalaya. Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, appearing for the Appellant in C.A. Diary No. 3067 of 2018 and Shri Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel, appearing for the Appellant in C.A. No. 10907/2018. Shri Colin Gonsalves, learned senior Counsel has been heard as amicus curiae. We have also heard learned Counsel for Respondent No. 1 in C.A. No. 5272 of 2016 (who was the Applicant before the NGT). Shri Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior Counsel has been heard for the private Respondents in C.A. No. 5272 of 2016. Shri A.N.S. Nadkarni, learned Additional Solicitor General has been heard for the Union of India. We have also heard other learned Counsel who were permitted to intervene in the matter and raise various arguments in respect of their different IAs.
23. Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior Counsel led the arguments on behalf of the State of Meghalaya. Shri Naphade submits that jurisdiction of NGT constituted under National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is confined to Sections 14, 15 and 16. Section 16 is not attracted in the present case. Section 14 deals with original jurisdiction of NGT and it takes within its compass or all of civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment (including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment) is involved and such question arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I. The jurisdiction depends upon two conditions which are required to be satisfied cumulatively and they are: (1) substantial question which relates to environment and (2) implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I. It is submitted that Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957(hereinafter referred to as "MMDR Act, 1957") not being specified in Schedule I, the National Green Tribunal could not have exercised jurisdiction to examine violation of MMDR Act, 1957. It is submitted that the NGT committed error in holding that the coal mining in State of Meghalaya is unregulated. The NGT proceeded on erroneous premise that the Tribals of Meghalaya cannot do coal mining without obtaining lease from the State Government. It is submitted that Tribals who are owners of the land are also owners of the sub-soil and the minerals in the land. The land in the State of Meghalaya was property of men and villages. The Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills have different land tenure system of their own, which does not provide for vesting of land or minerals in the State right from pre-Independence period.
24. Shri Naphade submits that the ownership of minerals vests with the owner of the land unless the owner of the land is deprived of the same by some valid process of law, for example, the provision contained in Land Revenue Codes of different States, which categorically state that the ownership of minerals exclusively vests in the State Government. However, in the State of Meghalaya, there exists no such law that deprives the owner of the land from owning the minerals beneath it.
25. Shri Naphade submits that under MMDR Act, 1957, State has no legislative or executive power with regard to coal, which is a major mineral. It can neither exercise any jurisdiction of granting any mining lease to the Tribals nor it has any jurisdiction to frame any mining policy. It is submitted that the provisions of the MMDR Act deal with lease and prospecting licence. The Tribals of Meghalaya are owners of the minerals located in their land. Since they are the owners, there is no question of they being required to obtain either a prospecting licence or a mining lease. The concepts of lease and licence necessarily involve minimum two parties to the transaction-in case of a license, there has to be a licensor and licensee. The owner of minerals cannot give licence or lease to himself or grant a prospecting licence. The State is not the owner of the minerals and, therefore, it cannot on its own grant prospecting licence or lease as it has no proprietary right in respect of such minerals. State can neither be a licensor nor a lessor in such situation.
26. Shri Naphade reiterates that the whole premise of NGT that the coal mining in the State of Meghalaya is unregulated is fully erroneous. Referring to northeastern area under which the State of Meghalaya was established as full-fledged State, it is submitted that administration of Tribal areas is to be governed as per Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India and various orders passed by the NGT directly interfered in the administration of Tribal area which is vested in the Autonomous District Councils. It is submitted that NGT failed to consider the relevant statutory matrix including the provisions of Sixth Schedule and legislation framed by the Autonomous District Councils. It is submitted that NGT has no jurisdiction to constitute any committee for the purpose of enforcing its orders. The constitution of committees including constitution of Justice B.P. Katakey, former Judge of the Gauhati High Court by the impugned order dated 31.08.2018 is beyond the jurisdiction of NGT. The constitution of the committee is interference with the jurisdiction of Autonomous District Council. It is further submitted that NGT has also no jurisdiction to create any fund. The Tribunal by constituting the committee and by constituting a fund has created a parallel Government. The Tribunal not being a constitutional court it cannot issue a continuous mandamus. It is submitted that Tribunal although issued several directions to the State of Meghalaya to frame mining policy whereas the State has no jurisdiction regarding framing of mining policy under MMDR Act, 1957, the State is denuded with any legislative powers with regard to Regulation and development of minerals, which have been declared by the Union to have taken under its control. Referring to EIA notification dated 14.09.2006 issued under Environment Protection Act, 1986, he submitted that environment clearance for mining was required only when area of mining was more than five hectares. In Tribal areas of State of Meghalaya, mining area consists of small area which being not more than five hectares, there was no requirement of obtaining an environment clearance. He does not dispute that after 15.01.2016 by the EIA notification now the requirement of area of being not more than five hectares having been deleted environment clearance is required as on date with regard to carrying mining operations. The Tribals are dependent for their livelihood on coal mining and, therefore, by complete ban on coal mining with effect from 17.04.2014, large number of Tribals are deprived from their livelihood and it is obligatory for the State to espouse the cause of the Tribals, who individually were not before the NGT. There being no jurisdiction in the State of Meghalaya to grant mining lease as per special nature of land tenure in the Tribal areas of State of Meghalaya and further minerals are not vested in the State of Meghalaya, the NGT erred in holding that State has failed to carry on its obligation and failed to check coal mining in the State of Meghalaya, it is Central Government which have all jurisdiction and authorities under Act, 1957 to make necessary Rules and issue necessary directions and State alone cannot be blamed. Referring to Minerals Concession Rules, 1960 framed Under Section 13 of MMDR Act, 1957, it is submitted that even though Rule 13(f) refers to mining application with regard to land of which minerals vest in persons other than the Government, he submits that this provision shall not apply for owner when he himself carries on the mining, the question of taking lease may arise when owner of the land give land to some other person to mine the minerals.
27. Shri Naphade, however, submits that the provisions of the Mines Act, 1952 are applicable and have to be complied with. He referred to the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988, where cess can be charged by the State.
28. Shri Amrendra Sharan, learned senior Counsel appearing for the State of Meghalaya in C.A. No. 2968 of 2019 submits that NGT vide impugned order dated 04.01.2019 has directed the State of Meghalaya to deposit Rs. 100 crores as an interim measure which is wholly unsustainable. The NGT has passed the order dated 04.01.2019 relying on first interim report of the Committee headed by Justice B.P. Katakey, former Judge of the Gauhati High Court. The constitution of committee was itself beyond the jurisdiction of the NGT. Shri Sharan adopts the submissions made by Shri Naphade and in addition to those submissions, submits that order dated 04.01.2019 has been passed in violation of principles of natural justice since no opportunity was given to the State of Meghalaya to respond to the report of the committee used against it for imposing a penalty of Rs. 100 crores. The order impugned has been made by the NGT contrary to the findings recorded in the report of the committee of Justice B.P. Katakey. The impugned order dated 04.01.2019 has been passed by the NGT without any assessment of damage of environment whatsoever. The Tribunal also did not notice its earlier order dated 25.03.2015 wherein penalty has already been imposed on actual polluters, i.e., coal miners and transporters based on Polluters Pay Principle for which Fund, namely, Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund (hereinafter referred to as "MEPRF") has already been created. The NGT passed order dated 04.01.2019 without considering the concerned statutory provisions to determine as to who is responsible for implementation of the mining statutes and the environmental legislation in the State of Meghalaya. The state of Meghalaya has limited source of revenue and putting extra burden of Rs. 100 Crores shall shatter the economy of the state.
29. Shri Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel, in support of Appellant, Garo Hills Autonomous District Council in Civil Appeal No. 10907 of 2018 submits that the NGT while passing order dated 31.08.2018 has ignored the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. By order dated 31.08.2018, the NGT could not have constituted the committee. Referring to Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, Shri Raju Ramachandran submits that under para 2, District Councils, Regional Councils have been constituted and also Hills District Council is a Council created under the Sixth Schedule of the constitution framed Under Article 244(2) and Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India. The constitution of committee by the NGT has virtually affected District Autonomous Council from issues concerning administration of forests and lands within the exclusive jurisdiction of the council. The ban of coal mining has deprived the Appellant from major source of Revenue. Under para 8 of Sixth Schedule, Autonomous District Council is entitled to share the Revenue from minerals royalty collected by the State Government. The impugned order has been passed without hearing and taking note of existence of shareholders or stake of shareholders. Shri Raju Ramachandran further submits that NGT has disposed of OA Nos. 73/2014, 13/2014 and 186/2014 by order dated 31.08.2018 after this, it could not have passed any order.
30. Learned Counsel for the Appellant in support of C.A. No. 5272 of 2016 submits that the appeal filed by the Appellant is only for seeking protection of the proprietary rights of its members over the coal which was mined as per prevailing custom prior to 17.04.2014. It is submitted that by order dated 31.03.2016, NGT had taken the view that all coal after 2016 shall vest in the State. The Appellant had previously approached this Court by filing C.A. No. 4793 of 2016 against the order dated 31.03.2016 wherein this Court granted the liberty to the Appellant to approach the NGT for filing application for clarification of the order. The application of the Appellant for clarification was rejected by the NGT without giving any reason. The NGT had overreached the scope of its jurisdiction and authority in directing for vesting of the coal extracted by the members from their land in the State. It is further submitted that MMDR Act, 1957 was enacted by the Parliament to regulate the mining activities in the country which does not in any manner purport to declare the proprietary rights to the State in the minerals.
31. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior Counsel in support of C.A.(D) No. 3067 of 2018 submits that the Tribunal committed error in stopping the entire coal mining in the State of Meghalaya. Referring to Section 15 of NGT Act, 2010, Shri Ranjit Kumar submits that relief, compensation and restitution can be granted as provided in Section 15. It is submitted that by stopping entire coal mining from 17.04.2014 the livelihood of Appellant and several similarly situated persons had been adversely affected. It is submitted that the Tribunal ought to have lifted the ban. Order impugned infringes right Under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Tribunal has acted beyond its power Under Section 15 of NGT Act, 2010. The finding of the Tribunal on mining that in the State of Meghalaya mining is unregulated is not correct, whereas, a miner is required to get registered and it has to pay royalty fixed by the State of Meghalaya.
32. Shri Ranjan Mukherjee, learned Counsel appearing for Respondent No. 2, State of Meghalaya in C.A. No. 3067(D) of 2019 submits that even if rat-hole mining has been banned, all mining cannot be banned. He submits that the Meghalaya Mines and Minerals Policy, 2012 has been formulated with an aim to facilitate systematic, scientific and planned utilisation of mineral resources and to streamline mineral based development of the State. The State of Meghalaya has been created to follow the customary rights and practices of coal mining in the Tribal areas of Meghalaya. In this regard letter of Central Government dated 02.07.1987 has also been relied. The draft guidelines for coal mining activities in the State has also been framed in the year 2015. Although, NGT has directed Ministry of Environment and Forests to look into the matter but no objection has been communicated to the State except certain miner discrepancies.
33. Shri A.S. Nadkarni, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India submits that provisions of MMDR Act, 1957 are also applicable in the Tribal areas of State of Meghalaya. The request submitted by the Government of Meghalaya for issuance of Presidential Notification under Paragraph 12A(b) of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India for exempting the State of Meghalaya from certain provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957 has not been acceded to. The Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2019 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Coal has been referred to and relied by the learned Additional Solicitor General in this regard. It is submitted that no prior approval for mining rights in respect of area containing coal has been given under MMDR Act, 1957 by Ministry of Coal, Government of India for the State of Meghalaya.
34. It is submitted that it is entirely impermissible for the Appellant or any other private person to claim any rights for illegal or unlawful mining of coal in derogation of the law in force in the State of Meghalaya. It is further submitted that generation of revenue would not be a ground for claiming permission to carry out mining in contravention/derogation of the law in force. A draft guideline submitted by the State Government of Meghalaya by letter dated 24.09.2015 was examined by the Ministry of Coal, Government of India on which decision was taken that the guidelines submitted by the Government of Meghalaya were not in conformity with the existing statutory provisions of MMDR Act, 1957. Hence, the State of Meghalaya may reframe the guidelines in conformity with MMDR Act, 1957 and submit. In the revised proposal dated 25.07.2016 the State of Meghalaya had proposed certain amendments in MMDR Act, 1957 and exemption from the application of the MMDR Act, 1957 through a Presidential notification under Para 12A(b) of the Sixth Schedule. It had already been communicated by Central Government that exemption from applicability of MMDR Act, 1957 cannot be acceded to.
35. Shri Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel, appearing as amicus curiae, has raised various submissions. Learned amicus curiae has submitted a Report in two volumes titled "CURSE OF UNREGULATED COAL MINING IN MEGHALAYA", a citizen's Report from Meghalaya 01/12/2018. In Volume I under the head 'INTRODUCTION' the Report states:
INTRODUCTION
Meghalaya has a resource curse. Although, we have been endowed with abundant forests and minerals, these resources have not contributed to the good of our society, because they have been extracted without any Regulation or concern for the larger common good. This unregulated, narrow, self-interest based use of natural resources has exacerbated socio-economic inequality, destroyed the environment, heightened criminality, and torn as under our egalitarian tribal social fabric.
It also violates Section(sic Article) 39(b) of the Constitution which provides that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community should be so distributed so as to best subserve the common good and, therefore, the State cannot distribute the material resource of the community in any way it likes. The process of distribution must be guided by the constitutional principles including the doctrine of equality and larger public good.
The National Green Tribunal's landmark order regarding Unregulated and illegal coal mining in our state therefore came as a wakeup call for Meghalaya society at large. This order has been criticised and appealed against by a small Section of locals most of who are coal mine owners, transporters, politicians and administrators who have 'illegally' benefitted out of this unregulated mining and who want things to get back to business as usual. Coal Miners and politicians who are miners, truck owners, weigh bridge operators etc. have been filed appeals with the Honourable Supreme Court, asking the Hon'ble Court to rescind NGT orders so that mining can once again begin.
36. Learned amicus curiae submits that State of Meghalaya still continues with the illegal mining. Shri Gonsalves submits that Section 4 of MMDR Act, 1957 by use of words "no person" clearly prohibits mining operation without obtaining mining lease in accordance with the Act. Referring to Section 5, he submits that for Schedule A minerals permission of Central Government is required which has not been obtained. Shri Gonsalves submits that for mining, the leases are required and permission be sought. He submits that there are 53 mines per kilometre in Tribal areas of Meghalaya. He submits that all extracted coal which is claimed to be lying assessed or unassessed in the State of Meghalaya is result of illegal mining and Coal India Ltd. be directed to take over the entire coal.
37. Shri Gonsalves has also referred to various reports of Comptroller and Auditor General of India which has been brought on record in Volume II-A Citizen's Report from Meghalaya 06/01/2019.
38. Shri Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of private Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 5272 of 2016 has refuted the submissions raised by the learned Counsel for the Appellants. Shri Nidhesh Gupta submits that as per Entry 54 of List I Regulation of mines and minerals development has been declared by the Parliament under MMDR Act, 1957. Section 2, by declaration as contained in MMDR Act, 1957, the State Government is denuded of all legislative and executive powers under Entry 23 of List II read with Article 162 of the Constitution of India. Section 4 Sub-section (1) makes it clear that no person can undertake any reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations in any area, except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a reconnaissance permit or of a prospecting licence. As per Section 5 Sub-section (1) A State Government shall not grant a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease to any person unless such person is an Indian National and satisfies such conditions as may be prescribed. The proviso to Section 5(1) provides that in respect of any mineral specified in Part A and Part B of the First Schedule, no reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease shall be granted except with the previous approval of the Central Government. The contention on behalf of the State of Meghalaya that the MMDR Act, 1957 does not apply to State of Meghalaya is based on an erroneous reading of the statutory provisions.
39. Section 13 empowers the Central Government to make Rules for regulating the grant of reconnaissance permits, prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of land in which minerals vest in the Government and also in respect of any land in which the minerals vest in a person other than the Government. In exercise of powers Under Section 13 of the Act, the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 have been framed.
40. Chapter V deals with the procedure for obtaining a prospecting licence or a mining lease in respect of a land in which the minerals vest in a person other than the Government. The said Chapter contains provisions from Rule 41 to Rule 52. Rule 41 stipulates that the provisions of the said Chapter apply only to the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of land in which minerals vest exclusively in a person other than the Government. Therefore, mining leases in respect of land where minerals vest in a person other than the Government are covered by the said Chapter and matters concerning grant of prospecting licences and mining leases are detailed therein.
41. As per Section 23C, the State Government is empowered to make Rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals. No Rules have been framed by the State of Meghalaya Under Section 23C. The contention on behalf of State of Meghalaya that MMDR Act applies only in the cases where minerals vest in Government, therefore, MMDR Act does not apply in the State of Meghalaya, is completely misconceived.
42. Learned Counsel also relies on the stand taken by the Union of India in the Status Report dated 24.07.2018. Shri Gupta submits that approximate price of coal is Rs. 10,000/- per metric ton. Referring to notice inviting tenders by the State of Meghalaya, it is submitted that amount of Rs. 1,000/- per metric ton was contemplated. It is submitted that selling the coal on much low price is causing loss to Revenue as well as loss to other stakeholders. The allegations have been by Shri Gupta that sale of coal at such low price raises suspicion of under hand dealing. It is submitted that legal position be laid down by this Court and the orders of the NGT be upheld.
43. In addition to above, we have also heard several learned counsels who have filed IA for impleadment and IAs for direction including direction to transport coal belonging to them. We have heard Shri Siddharth Luthra, Shri R. Basant, Smt. Meenakshi Arora, Senior Advocates and other learned counsel.
44. On 10.05.2019, we had passed an order permitting transportation of coal to the extent of 75,050 metric ton which was balance quantity from 1,76,655 metric ton of coal, for transportation of which this Court had passed order on 04.12.2018. The order dated 10.05.2019 permitted transportation of the coal, for which Transport challans had already been issued after 04.12.2018 under the terms and conditions as indicated in the order dated 10.05.2019. In the order dated 10.05.2019, we had also held that applicants need not be impleaded, however, they were permitted to intervene in the matter.
45. The counsel appearing for different applicants claim transportation of different quantity of coal which according to them has now been assessed. Still some of the applicants claims transportation of the coal which is yet to be assessed. In different applications, different quantities are claimed to be transported which according to the Applicant is lying in different districts of the State of Meghalaya. I.A. No. 22981 of 2019 and I.A. No. 22991 of 2019 are applications by an Applicant claiming to be auction purchaser. learned Counsel submitted that he was declared highest bidder, he pleaded for extension of time to deposit the amount but after the order dated 15.01.2019, he was not permitted to transport the coal nor he could deposit the balance auction money.
46. Shri Ranjan Mukherjee, learned Counsel appearing for State of Meghalaya has filed an additional affidavit of Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya, Mining and Geology Department dated 06.04.2019. In the affidavit, it is stated that in pursuance of the order of NGT dated 31.08.2018, the State Government vide notification dated 14.09.2018 has constituted a team to assist the Commissioner and Secretary to deal with the directives given in para 13 of the order of the NGT. It is submitted that in pursuance of the order of the State Government dated 14.09.2018, the members of the committee have carried out assessment of unassessed extracted coal appearing in the datasheet of inventory in different hills district. The report dated 04.10.2018 of Deputy Commissioner, west Khasi hills, is filed as Annexure A-3, containing the statement of unassessed extracted coal has been brought on record. Another report dated 22.10.2018 and 16.11.2018 of west Khasi hills district containing the statement of assessment of unassessed extracted coal has been brought on record. By report dated 12.11.2018 of Deputy Commissioner, South west Khasi hills, datasheet of coal inventory has been brought on the record. Report dated 30.10.2018, Deputy Commissioner, South Garo hills, has also been brought on record. There were reports referring to different assessment carried out by the committee according to the affidavit which has been filed on behalf of the Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya, the total quantity of coal stock which has now been assessed in different reports stands at 32,56,715 metric ton.
47. It is further submitted by learned Counsel for the State of Meghalaya that above assessment of coal has been also verified by technical committees appointed by the State of Meghalaya. Certain reports of technical committees have also been brought on the record along with the affidavit.
48. Shri Colin Gonsalves, learned Amicus Curiae has challenged the assessment made by the committees appointed by the State Government as well as verification by technical committee report. It is submitted by Shri Gonsalves that report of technical committee wants to undo what has been done in the proceedings before the tribunal and this Court. Learned Amicus Curiae submits that for transportation, five extensions were granted by NGT and four extensions were granted by this Court. Shri Gonsalves referred to Katakey committee report in support of his submissions.
49. Shri Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior Counsel, has also refuted the claim of the different applicants as well as the steps taken by the State of Meghalaya in assessing the coal and verifying the same by technical committee. Shri Gupta submits that the coal which is now claimed to be assessed is nothing but illegally extracted coal. It is submitted that in pursuance of several orders passed by NGT and this Court substantial transportation of coal has been permitted, still the enormous quantity of coal is claimed which is nothing but an excuse to obtain an order of transportation of such illegally mined coal. It is submitted that State of Meghalaya is hand in glove with illegal miners. Shri Gupta submits that the cost of winning coal by rat hole mining is negligible and after payment of royalty of Rs. 675/- and Rs. 485/- towards Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund i.e. total payment of Rs. 1160/-, the coal is transported. The market price of the coal is approximately Rs. 10,000/- per metric ton. The claim of different applicants with regard to unassessed coal is false. It is submitted that all illegally mined coal should be vested in the State and no permission of transport as prayed by the different applicants be granted by this Court. Learned senior advocate submits that all applications praying for different directions deserve to be rejected.
50. Learned Counsel for the parties in support of their respective submissions have placed reliance on various judgments of this Court which shall be referred to while considering the submissions of the parties.
51. From the submissions of the parties as noted above and the materials on record in these appeals following points arise for consideration.

53. Now we proceed to consider the above points in seriatim.
Point No. 1
54. The State of Meghalaya submits that NGT while imposing ban on mining and by forming committee and creating a "Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund" has gone beyond its jurisdiction as conferred on it by NGT Act, 2010. The Tribunal has no inherent jurisdiction, its jurisdiction flow from Sections 14, 15 and 16 of the Act.
55. It is relevant to notice few provisions of NGT Act, 2010 to comprehend the jurisdiction vested with the Tribunal. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment and giving relief and compensation for damages to persons and property and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 2 is definitions. Section 2(c) defines environment in the following manner:
2(c) "environment" includes water, air and land and the inter-relationship, which exists among and between water, air and land and human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro-organism and property;
56. Section 2(m) defines substantial question relating environment which is to the following effect:
2(m) "substantial question relating to environment" shall include an instance where,-- (i) there is a direct violation of a specific statutory environmental obligation by a person by which,-- (A) the community at large other than an individual or group of individuals is affected or likely to be affected by the environmental consequences; or (B) the gravity of damage to the environment or property is substantial; or (C) the damage to public health is broadly measurable; (ii) the environmental consequences relate to a specific activity or a point source of pollution;
57. Chapter III of the Act deals with jurisdiction, powers and proceedings of the Tribunal. Sections 14 and 15 which are relevant in the present case are as follows:
14. Tribunal to settle disputes.--(1) The Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment (including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment), is involved and such question arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I.
1. Ins. by Act 7 of 2017, Section 182 (w.e.f. 26-5-2017).
(2) The Tribunal shall hear the disputes arising from the questions referred to in Sub-section (1) and settle such disputes and pass order thereon.
(3) No application for adjudication of dispute under this Section shall be entertained by the Tribunal unless it is made within a period of six months from the date on which the cause of action for such dispute first arose:
Provided that the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that the Applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the application within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days.
15. Relief, compensation and restitution.--
(1) The Tribunal may, by an order, provide,--
(a) relief and compensation to the victims of pollution and other environmental damage arising under the enactments specified in the Schedule I (including accident occurring while handling any hazardous substance);
(b) for restitution of property damaged;
(c) for restitution of the environment for such area or areas, as the Tribunal may think fit.
(2) The relief and compensation and restitution of property and environment referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Sub-section (1) shall be in addition to the relief paid or payable under the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991 (6 of 1991).
(3) No application for grant of any compensation or relief or restitution of property or environment under this Section shall be entertained by the Tribunal unless it is made within a period of five years from the date on which the cause for such compensation or relief first arose:
Provided that the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that the Applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the application within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days.
(4) The Tribunal may, having regard to the damage to public health, property and environment, divide the compensation or relief payable under separate heads specified in Schedule II so as to provide compensation or relief to the claimants and for restitution of the damaged property or environment, as it may think fit.
(5) Every claimant of the compensation or relief under this Act shall intimate to the Tribunal about the application filed to, or, as the case may be, compensation or relief received from, any other court or authority.
58. The submission which has been pressed by the State is that neither MMDR Act, 1957 nor Mines Act, 1952 is prescribed in Schedule I of the Act, hence, coal mining is not within the purview of Schedule I and not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The submission further is that for applicability of Section 14 both the component of Sub-section (1) of Section 14 that (i) a substantial question relating to environment and (ii) such question arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I has to be satisfied.
59. It is relevant to notice that before the NGT no such plea was taken by the State of Meghalaya or any of the parties questioning the jurisdiction of the NGT. However, the issue being a jurisdictional issue, we have permitted the learned Counsel for the Appellant to raise the issue. The NGT took cognizance when application, O.A. No. 73 of 2014 on 17.04.2014 was admitted and order was issued. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain O.A. No. 73 of 2014 has to be found out from the case set up and pleadings in O.A. No. 73 of 2014 for which we need to scrutinise the application. O.A. No. 73 of 2014 has been brought on record as Annexure-A3 in C.A. No. 5272 of 2016. The application was filed by one All Dimasa Students Union Dima Hasao District Committee. In the application following were the Respondents:
1. The State of Meghalaya through the Principal Secretary, Forest and Environment Department, Government of Meghalaya, Shillong. 2. The Chairperson, State Pollution Control Board, Meghalaya, Shillong. 3. The State of Assam through the Principal Secretary, Forest and Environment Department Government of Assam, Dispur. 4. The Chairperson, State Pollution Control Board, Assam, Dispur. 5. The Central Pollution Control Board, Parvesh Bhawan, East Arjun Nagar, Delhi-110032 through its Chairperson. 6. North Easter Electric Power Corporation Ltd. through its Chairman and Managing Director Brooklyn Compound, Lower New Colony, Shillong-793003. Meghalaya.
60. Paragraph 3 of the application states the case of the Applicant and facts in brief. Paragraph 3 and (I) to (VI) are as follows:
3. The Applicant above named beg to present the present Application to bring to the notice of this Hon'ble Tribunal about the adverse impact of unscientific opencast mining operations being still undertaken in the Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya on the ecology and socio-economy of the concerned area including Dima Hasao District of Assam. It is stated that the Acid Mine Drainage (for short (AMD') generated from the aforesaid mining operations has resulted in making the water of the river Kopili (an inter-state river flowing through the State of Meghalaya and Assam) and its tributaries highly acidic which in turn has not only caused serious far reaching damage to the environment, water bodies, soil, agriculture, economy, and industry of the concerned area but also resulted in causing erosion/corrosion of the critical underwater Hydro Power Equipments of the Kopili Hydro-Electric Project (for short 'KHEP') of the North-Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. (for short 'NEEPCO') situated in Umrongso, Dima Hasao, District of Assam in as much as the said acidic water is ultimately led to the reservoirs of the said project.
FACTS IN BRIEF
I. That the Applicant is the Secretary of the Dima Hasao Students Association and filing the present Petition in a representative capacity to espouse the cause of the people of Dima Hasao, Assam who are constantly and continuously facing the adverse affect of the aforesaid illegal activities in the State of Meghalaya.
II. That the Kopili River is an interstate river in North-East India that flows through the States of Meghalaya and Assam and is the largest south bank tributary of the river Brahmaputra in Assam, The Kopili river originates from the black mountains of Lum Bah-bo Bah-Kong in Meghalaya and flows north-west into the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam. The said river demarcates the Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya and Dirria Hasao in Assam. The river flows for a total length of 290 kms and has a catchment area of 16, 420 Kms.
III. That the Kopili Hydro-Electric Project (KHEP) of NEEPCO (a Government of India undertaking) is one of the pioneering Hydro-Electric Project in the North Eastern Region of India. The Kopili Hydro-Electric Plant is a 275 MW storage type hydro electric plant consisting of two dams which have created two reservoirs namely Kopili reservoir is used in the Khandong powerhouse through a 2759 metre tunnel to generate power. The tail water from this powerhouse is led to the Umrong reservoir is used in Kopili powerhouse through a 5473 metre tunnel to generate power. Although, the dam, powerhouse and residential colony of. kopili Hydro Electric Planer (KHEP) are located in the Dima Hasao District (formerly known as North Cachar Hills District) of Assam, the catchment and reservoirs are spread in two states namely Meghalaya and Assam. It is further stated that the Kopili River and its tributaries feed water to the reservoirs of the project. The Kharkor is a major tributary of river Kopili and drains a vast area of Jaintia Hills Districts of Meghalaya. The Jaintia Hills being well known for coal mining areas is contributing acidic water in the form of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) to the river Kharkor through its different tributaries such as Urn Pai, Myntriang, Urn Ropang, Sarbang, Mostem etc. as these streams drain through the active and inactive coal mining areas of Jaintia Hills. The acidic water finally reaches to Khandong and Umrong reservoirs of KHEP. As a result, the water of the reservoirs has become highly acidic. The water pollution in streams of catchment area varies from brownish to reddish orange. The same polluted water through various tributaries of rivers Kharkor and Kopili is perpetually reaching to the reservoirs of the KHEP. As a result, the water of reservoirs has become highly acidic. In recent years, it has been found that acidity of reservoir water is a major threat to equipments and machinery due to corrosion/metal decay and erosion. Components such as cooling water header pipe, Bends, throttling valves, pressure equalizer pipe of turbine etc. made up of different metals and alloys are getting severely affected and incurring high maintenance cost.
IV. That the said adverse impact of the aforesaid mining operation which has not only affected the ecology and socio-economy of the area but also severely affected the generation of hydro-electricity at the Kopili Hydro-Electric Plant has been subject matter of various studies. In fact, a detailed project report of pilot project for remediation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) in the catchment of Kopili River at the upstream of Kopili Hydro Electric Plant (KHEP), Umrongso, Dima Hasao, Assam was done by Dr. O.P. Singh, Professor, Department of Environmental Studies, North-Eastern Hills University, Shillong, Meghalaya. Similarly, a detailed Article based on detailed investigation by Shri Pankaj Sharma and others was published under the heading "Acid mine discharge -- Challenges met in a hydro power project" in the International Journal of Environmental Sciences, Volume I, No. 6, 2011. Both the aforesaid publications gives an in depth analysis of the aforesaid problem as well as suggests remedial measures to improve the situation. However, it is stated that no proper and effective remedial measures have been taken by the concerned authorities/State Respondents to abort the aforesaid menace and the ill-effect of the same are still continuing and the same are being constantly faced by the innocent citizens/water bodies etc of the area including the people of Dima Hasao district of Assam. Copies of the detailed project report of pilot project for remediation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) in the catchment of Kopili River at the upstream of Kopili Hydro Electric Plant (KHEP), Umrongso, Dima Hasao, Assam and the Article published under the heading "Acid mine discharge -- Challenges met in a hydro power project" in the International Journal of Environmental Sciences, Volume I, No. 6, 2011 are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-P/1 & P-2 respectively. The ill-effect of the aforesaid operations has also been the subject matter of news items in various newspapers including one published by the Assam Tribune on June, 20, 2012 under the heading "Concern over contamination of Kopili Water" and another one published in the Telegraph on 20.06.2013 under the heading "Two Kopili power units shut down -- Mining in Jaintia Hills affects machines". Copies of the news items published in the Assam Tribune dated 20.06.2012 and the Telegraph dated 20.06.2013 are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-P/3 & P-4 respectively.
61. In paragraph 3(V) the Appellant has extracted a report of one Dr. O.P. Singh, Professor, North-Eastern Hills University, Shillong, Meghalaya. Certain paragraphs of report stated that Acid Mine Drainage(AMD) is the greatest environmental problem of coal industry and main source of water pollution in and around mining areas. The report mentioned that AMD degrades the water quality of the area in terms of lowering the pH of the surrounding water resources and increasing the level of total suspended solids, total dissolved solids and some heavy metals. Following is the part of the paragraph 4.1.4 of the report which is extracted in paragraph 3(V):
4.1.4 Impact of AMD on Environment, Socio-economy and Industry
Impact on Environment and Water Resources:
Acid mine drainage is the greatest environmental problem of coal mining industry and main source of water pollution in and around mining areas. The influx of untreated AMD into streams severely degrades both water quality and aquatic habitat turning water unfit for desired uses and often producing an environment devoid of most aquatic life. AMD degrades the water quality of the area in terms of lowering the pH of the surrounding water resources and increasing the level of total suspended solids, total dissolved solids and some heavy metals. Acidity and high concentration of SO42; iron and other metals prove to be toxic and corrosive to most aquatic animals and plants. Precipitate of iron hydroxide increases the load of suspended solids which impair light penetration and visibility resulting into low productivity and disruption of normal functioning of the contaminated aquatic ecosystem. AMD can also be toxic to vegetation when discharged to the shallow soil water zones and wetlands (Van Green et al., 1999; Singh and Agrawal, 2004; Gosh, 1991).
Aquatic communities of rivers and streams comprise of phytoplanktoris, periphyton, macrophytes, zooplanktons, invertebrates and vertebrate species. They play important role in normal functioning of the aquatic ecosystem and are indicative of good health of water bodies. Generally, a variety of species with representatives of almost all insect orders, including a high diversity of insects belonging to the taxonomic orders of Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies) commonly referred to as EPT taxa. Any physical, chemical or biological change in water bodies affects one or all species and disturbs the normal functioning of the aquatic ecosystem. Like many other pollutants, AMID contamination causes a reduction in the diversity and total numbers, or abundance, of these aquatic communities including benthic macroinvertebrates, fishes, etc. As a result, the community structure is altered and water bodies affected by AMD possess a lower percentage of EPT taxa (Campbell et al., 2000). Moderate AMD contamination eliminates the more sensitive species whereas severely contaminated conditions are characterized by dominance of certain taxonomic representatives of pollution tolerant organisms.
As a consequence of depletion of aquatic invertebrates, the fishes do not get adequate supply of food and suffer indirectly from AMD contamination AMD also has direct effect on fish by causing various physiological disturbances. However, the primary cause of fish death in acid waters is loss of sodium ions from the blood. Less availability of oxygen to the cells and tissues leads to anoxia and death as acid water increases the permeability of fish gills to water, adversely affecting the gill function. Severe anoxia occurs below pH 4.2. Low H that is not directly lethal may adversely affect fish growth rates and reproduction.
62. Further, paragraph 4.2.3 of the report dealt with coal mining in Jaintia Hills and paragraph 4.2.4 dealt with impact of coal mining in Jaintia Hills and paragraph 4.2.5 dealt with degradation of water quality due to coal mining. Paragraphs 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 which were extracted in O.A. No. 73 of 2014 are produced as below:
4.2.3 Coal Mining in Jaintia Hills
Extraction of coal has been taking place in all three regions, however, 'major production occurs in Jaintia Hills. The mining activity in Jaintia Hills is a small scale venture controlled by individuals who own the land. Primitive mining method commonly known as 'rat-hole' mining is in practice in Meghalaya. In this method the land is first cleared by cutting and removing the ground vegetation and then digging pits ranging from 5 to 100 m2 into the ground to reach the coal seam. Thereafter, tunnels are made into the seam sideways to extract the coal which is brought into the pit by using a conical basket or a wheel barrow manually. Coal seams are reached by excavating the side edge of the hill slopes and then coal is extracted through a horizontal tunnel. The coal from the tunnel or pit is taken out and dumped on nearby un-mined area, from where it is carried to the larger dumping places near highways for its trade and transportation. Finally, the coal is carried by trucks to the larger dumping places near highways for its trade and transportation. Entire road sides in and around mining areas are used for piling of coal which is a major source of air, water and soil pollution. Off road movement of trucks and other vehicles in the area causes further damage to the ecology of the area.
Every year new areas are brought under mining and area under coal mining in Jaintia Hills is increasing day-by-day as shown in Figure 4, 5.
4.2.4 Impact of Coal Mining in Jaintia Hills and Beyond
Mining operation, undoubtedly has brought wealth and employment opportunity in the area, but simultaneously has led to extensive environmental degradation and erosion of traditional values in the society. Environmental problems associated with mining have been felt severely because of the region's fragile ecosystems and richness of biological and cultural diversity. The indiscriminate and unscientific mining and absence of post-mining treatment and management of mined areas are making the fragile ecosystems more vulnerable to environmental degradation and leading to large scale land cover/land use changes. The current modus operandi of surface mining in the area generates huge quantity of mine spoil or overburden (consolidated and unconsolidated materials overlying the coal seam) in the form of gravels, rocks, sand, soil etc. which are dumped over a large area adjacent to the mine pits. The dumping of overburden and coal destroys the surrounding vegetation and leads to severe soil and water pollution. Large scale denudation of forest cover, scarcity of water, pollution of air, water and soil, and degradation of agricultural lands are some of the conspicuous environmental implications of coal mining in Jaintia Hills. Further, entire coal mining area of the Jaintia Hills has become full of mine pits and caves. These open, unfilled pits are the places where surface water percolates and disappears. As a result, smaller streams and rivers of the area, which served as life lines for the people, are either completely disappearing from the face of the earth or becoming seasonal instead. Consequently, the area is facing acute shortage of clean drinking and irrigation water. Besides, a vast area has become physically disfigured due to haphazard dumping of overburden and mined coal, and caving in of the ground and subsidence of land.
Continuous discharge of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) and toxic chemicals from coal mines, storage sites and exposed overburden have polluted the river system of the area. Acidic water on reaching to land and agricultural fields has affected the traditional agriculture and agricultural productivity of the area (Das Gupta et al, 2002; Swer and Singh, 2004)
4.2.5 Degradation of Water Quality due to Coal Mining
The water bodies of the area are the greatest victims of the coal mining. The water bodies are badly affected by contamination of Acid Mines Drainage (AMD) originating from mines and spoils, leaching of heavy metals, organic enrichment and silting by coal and sand particles. Pollution of the safer is evidenced by the colour of the water which in most of the rivers and streams in the mining area varies from brownish to reddish orange. Low pH (between 2-3), high conductivity, high concentration of sulphate, iron and toxic heavy metals, low dissolved oxygen (DO) and high BOD are some of the physic-chemical and biological parameters which' characterize the degradation of water quality. Analysis of physic-chemical and biological parameters of water in the mining area shows severe degradation of water quality.
The colour of the water in mining area generally varies from brownish to reddish orange. Siltation of coal particles,' sand, soil etc. and contamination of AMD and formation of iron hydroxide are some of the major causes of change in water colour. Formation of iron hydroxides [Fe (CH)31 is mainly responsible for orange or red colour of water in the mining areas.
Iron hydroxide is a yellowish insoluble material commonly formed in water bodies of the coalfields. It is this material that stains streams and responsible for red to orange color of water. When elevated levels of iron are introduced into natural waters, the iron is oxidized and hydrolyzed, thereby forming precipitate of iron hydroxides.
The water in coal mining areas has been found highly acidic. The pH of streams and rivers varies between 2.31 to 4.01. Solids such as fine particles of coal, sand, mud and other mineral particles were found deposited at the bottom of the water bodies. Besides, water was also found turbid and coloured due to suspended precipitates of iron hydroxides. Dissolved oxygen was found to be low in water bodies of coat mining areas, the lowest being 4.24 mg/L in river Rawaka and stream Metyngka of Rymbai.
The waters of the mining areas have been found containing sulphate concentration between 78 to 168 mg/L. Electrical conductivity is a rapid measure of the total dissolved solids present in ionic form. Water in coal mining areas was found having high conductivity. Deposition of silt at the bottom of the rivers and streams is another important problem in coal mining areas. Water bodies of the mining area appear to contain various types of organic matter which is evident by low Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand(BOD).
As a result, the rivers, streams and springs which had supported extremely rich biodiversity and traditional agriculture, and were source of potable and irrigation water in the area have become unfit for human consumption. Further, there is an overall decline in agricultural productivity due to contamination of soil with coal particles, seepage of Acid mines drainage and scarcity of water. The water of many rivers and streams have almost become devoid of aquatic life.
4.2.6 Causes of Deterioration of Water Quality
Major causes of deterioration of water quality, as evidenced by above observations are AMD discharge, siltation and organic enrichment. As in any other coal mining area, Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is the main source of water pollution in the coal mining areas of Jaintia Hills. As discussed in previous chapter, Amp is formed by a series of complex geochemical and microbial reactions that occur when water comes in contact with pyrite (Iron sulfide) found in coal and exposed rocks of overburden. Iron sulfide in presence of oxygen, water and bacteria forms sulphuric acid, is referred to as AMD. In the process, iron hydroxide, a yellowish orange precipitate is also formed. The precipitate of iron hydroxide together with other contaminants causes turbidity and changes in colour of the water which reduces the penetration of light and affects the aquatic life. Extremely low pH conditions in the water accelerate weathering and dissolution of silicate and other rock minerals, thereby causing the release of other elements such as aluminium, manganese, copper, cadmium etc. into the water. Hence, water contaminated with AMD is often coloured and turbid with suspended solids, highly acidic (low pH), and contains high concentration of dissolved metals and other elements. Most of the streams and rivers of Jaintia Hills in coal mining areas are severely contaminated with AMD and thus becomes water has become highly acidic. The pH and other parameters of some AMD affected water bodies are summarized in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Summary of water quality parameters in some Coal mining rivers/reservoir.
Source: Present study; GSI, 2006-7; Biahwar, 2010
The results show that most of the rivers in the coal mining areas of Jaintia Hills are severely affected AMD as evident from the lower pH values, higher sulphate content and EC in water samples.
63. Thus, there were clear allegations in the application that in spite of various remedial measures set out in the report no proper and effective remedial measures have been taken by the concerned authorities of the State of Meghalaya. Paragraph 3(VI) is as follows:
3(VI). That the various remedial measures are set out in detail in paragraphs 4.4, 4.5, 5, 5.1 and 5.2 and other relevant paragraphs of the said report. However, to the best of knowledge of the Applicant, no proper and effective remedial measures have been undertaken by the concerned authorities till date and the innocent citizens/water bodies etc. of the concerned areas including that of Dima Hasao District in Assam continue to be subjected to the ill-effect of the aforesaid illegal mining operation in the State of Meghalaya. That apart, continuous and irreparable damage on the environment, water, soil, agriculture etc. in the concerned areas including Dima Hasao district of Assam are also continuing as a result of the said illegal mining operations in Jaintia Hills in the State of Meghalaya.
64. Ground A of the application is also relevant to be reproduced which is to the following effect:
GROUNDS
A. that the aforementioned illegal mining operations in the Jaintia Hills in the State of Meghalaya have not only caused serious and irreparable damage to the ecology, water bodies and the socio-economy of the concerned areas including of Dima Hasao district of Assam but has also resulted in serious erosion/corrosion of the underwater plants and machineries and equipments of the Kopili Hydro Power Project of the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation of India (a Government of India undertaking), The ill-effect of the said mining operation has been highlighted in detail in the aforementioned detailed project report by Dr. O.P. Singh, Professor, North-Eastern Hills University as well as the said Article published in the International Journal of Environmental Sciences. Though remedial measures were suggested in both the aforesaid studies, to the best of the knowledge of the Applicant, no proper and effective remedial measures have been undertaken by the Respondents herein and the ill-effect of the said activities are still continuing to the detriment of the ecology, water bodied and socio-economy of the concerned areas including Dima Hasao district of Assam. It is most respectfully submitted that the total inaction on the part of the Respondents herein in spite of detailed study on the subject with remedial suggestions are totally inexcusable and show the total callous attitude of the State Respondents The menace of illegal opencast mining operations in the Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya is still continuing to the detriment of the ecology and socio-economic of the concerned areas including Dime Hasao district of Assam and as such, warrants, in the most respectful submissions of the Applicant, immediate intervention by this Hon'ble Tribunal. The aforesaid inaction has resulted in violation of the various enactments mentioned in Schedule I of the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 apart from infringing the fundamental rights of the Applicant Under Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
65. The pleadings in O.A. No. 73 of 2014 as extracted above clearly and categorically alleged environmental degradation consequent to illegal coal mining. It was further stated that inaction of Respondent authorities has resulted in violation of various enactments mentioned in Schedule I of the NGT Act, 2010 including the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act, 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The application O.A. No. 73 of 2014 thus has clearly made out allegations which were sufficient for the Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction as conferred by Section 14. Both the component as appearing in subsection 1 of Section 14 that is (i) substantial question relating to environment and (ii) such question arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I, were involved.
66. The NGT after adverting to the application O.A. No. 73 of 2014 on 17.04.2014 has undertaken different proceedings and asked for various reports from different committees including State Pollution Control Board. By order dated 31.08.2018, the NGT had appointed a committee headed by Justice B.P. Katakey, former Judge of the Gauhati High Court which consisted of Prof. Ashok K. Singh, Rajiv Gandhi Chair Professor, Department of Environmental Science & Engineering representative from Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad IIT(ISM), Dhanbad (826004), Dr. Shantanu Kumar Dutta, Scientist 'D' representative of Central Pollution Control Board. The said committee submitted interim report on 31.12.2018 and on the subject "Whether coal mining activities as well as dumping of coal results in adverse environmental effect, if so, the nature and extent thereof?" has been dealt with in Issue No. (D) in the following manner:
Issue No. (D) Whether coal mining activities as well as dumping of coal results in adverse environmental effect, if so, the nature and extent thereof?
(i) The Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board in the month of September, 1997 published a report entitled "ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF COAL MINING IN JAINTIA HILLS DISTRICT". The then Chairman of the said Board, in his foreword, has admitted unplanned and unscientific coal mining activities in the State for more than hundred years, which achieved dangerous dimensions since last two decades and are creating ecological disturbances and negative environmental impacts, to the extent that the very existence of biological life is threatened in the coal mining areas of the State. It has also been admitted that no systematic efforts to study such impacts have so far been made by any institution. The then Member Secretary of the Board, in the preface, has projected the adverse impacts on the environment because of the coal mining activities. The pH level of in water almost all the rivers and streams was found to be below the required level. In some rivers and streams, the pH level was found to be as low as 2.4. The Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board, in the said report, has observed that the random discharge of AMD and acidic run offs from-40-the coal storage areas have also made the rivers, streams and even ground waters highly acidic. The ambient air quality of the coal mining and coal storage areas was also found to be degraded to certain extent. The Board, therefore, observed that-"The uncontrolled and unscientific coal mining operations in Jaintia Hills District have already created massive ecological disturbances and environmental degradation because presently neither any pollution control measures are adopted by the miners nor any sincere efforts are made for reclamation of the mine land". In the said report, the following recommendations were made to minimize the overall adverse environmental impacts of the mining activities:
(a) To generate social awareness among the public in general and the miners in particular about the adverse environmental impacts and the health hazards associated with such unscientific and unplanned coal mining activities.
(b) Preparation of the inventory of the mine owners, areas under mining and rate of land use change to get the first hand knowledge about the quantum of the efforts required for better management of these activities.
(c) To enforce suitable legislations on the lines of the National Mineral Policy immediately for exploitation of coal in most sustainable manner.
(d) To engage expert institution for finding out the most suited technologies for the coal exploitation with appropriate pollution control measures in order to ensure that the environment as a whole is not subjected to further degradation.
(e) To engage the expert institution for finding out the suitable ways for rehabilitation of the mined land in phase manner so that the scarce land resources can be brought back to productive uses.
(f) To look for the alternative transport facilities to control vehicular pollution.
(g) To identify the suitable location for the storage of coal for sale with adequate facilities to treat dump run offs.
(h) To study the aspect of the presence of trace elements in the surface and ground water because the low pH values increase the dissolution power of water. Large numbers of trace elements are always associated with the coal which gets dissolved in low pH waters. These trace elements are serious health hazards even in very low concentrations.
(i) To introduce lucrative schemes for the aforestation in the most affected areas.
(j) To develop the State Mineral Policy with the interaction of Government Agencies, Social Institutions, Local Elders and the Miners, keeping in view the specific land ownership system of the State. Nothing of the above recommendations have been implemented so far.
(ii) It is, therefore, evident that apart from the water, air pollution, there is degradation of surface land because of the coal mining activities in the State of Meghalaya. Despite publication of the said report by the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board as back as in the year 1997, no steps appeared to have been taken by any authority to check the adverse environmental affect and also to remedy the same.
67. The present is not a case of mere allegation of Applicant of environmental degradation by illegal and unregulated coal mining rather there were materials on the record including the report of the experts, the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board published in the month of September, 1992, the report of Katakey committee appointed by the Tribunal where environmental degradation of water, air and surface of the land was proved.
68. Hence, there was sufficient allegation regarding substantial questions relating to environment and violation of enactments in Schedule I. We fail to see any substance in the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that NGT has no jurisdiction to entertain the case and pass orders. During submission, learned Counsel for the Appellant has not even referred to application which was filed by the Applicant in O.A. No. 73/2014. There were reports of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board before the State Government pointing out environmental degradation and the Tribunal having taken up the issue, the submission on behalf of the State that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction is not expected from the State Government who is under constitutional obligation to ensure clean environment to all its citizens. In cases pertaining to environmental matter the State has to act as facilitator and not as obstructionist. Article 48A of the Constitution provides:
48A. Protection and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and wild life The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country.
69. Learned Counsel for the Appellant has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Techi Tagi Tara v. Rajendra Singh Bhandari and others, MANU/SC/1217/2017 : 2018(11) SCC 734. This Court had occasion to consider Section 14, 15 and 2(m) of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, which involves the question of jurisdiction of NGT. The nature of order passed by NGT which was challenged before this Court has been noticed in para 1 of the judgment, which is to the following effect:
1. This batch of appeals is directed against the judgment and order dated 24-8-2016 passed by the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (for short "the NGT") in Rajendra Singh Bhandari v. State of Uttarakhand. On a reading of the judgment and order passed by the NGT, it is quite clear that the Tribunal was perturbed and anguished that some persons appointed to the State Pollution Control Boards (for short "SPCBs") did not have, according to the NGT, the necessary expertise or qualifications to be members or Chairpersons of such high-powered and specialised statutory bodies and therefore did not deserve their appointment or nomination. While we fully commiserate with the NGT and share the pain and anguish, we are of the view that the Tribunal has, at law, exceeded its jurisdiction in directing the State Governments to reconsider the appointments and in laying down guidelines for appointment to the SPCBs, however well-meaning they might be. Therefore, we set aside the decision of the NGT, but note that a large number of disconcerting facts have been brought out in the judgment which need serious consideration by those in authority, particularly the State Governments that make appointments or nominations to the SPCBs. Such appointments should not be made casually or without due application of mind considering the duties, functions and responsibilities of the SPCBs.
