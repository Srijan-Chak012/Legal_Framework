Case Note:

Mines and Minerals - Violation of provisions - Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957, Mineral Concessions Rules, 1960, Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Goa (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation of Minerals) Rules, 2013 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 - On basis of findings in report of Commission on illegal mining in State, Petitioner/Foundation filed present petition praying for directions to Union and State to take steps for termination of mining leases of lessees involved in mining in violation of Acts - Whether there was any violation of provisions of Act so that direction could be issued for termination of mining leases - Held, activity of dumping mineral wastes by lessees would pollute environment and there was no merit in their contention that they could dump mining waste outside leased area - Commission's report also submitted that in State, Companies were carrying out mining operations under different leases granted to them as single unit as if leases were amalgamated - Their submission was misconceived that no mining could be prohibited by Court - If State had not permitted amalgamation of adjoining leases in interest of mineral development and had not recorded reasons for permission, State could not allow amalgamation of leases - It was for State to decide as matter of policy in what manner leases of mineral resources would be granted, but in accordance with Rules and Acts in question - Deemed mining lease had already been expired and consequently mining by lessees was illegal - Hence, State was directed to initiate action against those mining leases which violated Rules and Acts and further directed to strictly enforce Rules, 2013 - Petition allowed.

LETTER PETITION AND PIL MATTER
JUDGMENT
A.K. Patnaik, J.
1. This batch of Writ Petitions and Transferred Cases relate to mining in the State of Goa and as issues raised are common to the Writ Petitions and the Transferred Cases, the cases have been analogously heard and are being disposed of by this common judgment.
Facts relating to mining in Goa:
2. Prior to 19.12.1961 when Goa was a Portuguese territory, its Portuguese Government had granted mining concessions in perpetuity to concessionaires. On 19.12.1961, Goa was liberated and became part of the Indian Union and on 01.10.1963, the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 (for short 'the MMDR Act') was made applicable to the State of Goa. On 10.03.1975, the Controller of Mining Leases issued a notification calling upon every lessee and sub-lessee to file returns under Rule 5 of the Mining Leases (Modification of Terms) Rules, 1956 and sent copies of the notification to the concessionaires in Goa. Aggrieved, the concessionaires moved the Bombay High Court, Goa Bench, and by judgment dated 29.09.1983, in Vassudeva Madeva Salgaocar v. Union of India [MANU/MH/0286/1983 : 1985 (1) Bom. CR 36], the Bombay High Court restrained the Union of India from treating the concessions as mining leases and from enforcing the notification against the concessionaires.
3. Parliament thereafter passed the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act, 1987 (for short 'the Abolition Act') which received the assent of the President on 23.05.1987. Section 4 of the Abolition Act abolished the mining concessions and declared that with effect from the 20th day of December, 1961, every mining concession will be deemed to be a mining lease granted under the MMDR Act and that the provisions of the MMDR Act will apply to such mining lease. Section 5 of the Abolition Act further provided that the concession holder shall be deemed to have become a holder of the mining lease under the MMDR Act in relation to the mines in which the concession relates and the period of such lease was to extend upto six months from the date when the Abolition Act received President's assent, i.e. upto 22.11.1987. On 14.10.1987, Sub-rules (8) and (9) were inserted in Rule 24A of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for short 'the MC Rules') which deal with renewal of mining leases in Goa, Daman and Diu. The Abolition Act was challenged by the lessees before the Bombay High Court in a writ petition. The High Court passed an interim order permitting the lessees to carry on mining operations and the mining business in the concessions for which renewal applications had been filed under Rule 24A of the MC Rules. Subsequently, the High Court held in its judgment dated 20.06.1997 that the Abolition Act was valid but Section 22(i)(a) of the Abolition Act would operate prospectively and not retrospectively. The concessionaires filed special leave petition against the judgment dated 20.06.1997 before this Court. On 02.03.1998, this Court passed an interim order permitting the concessionaires to carry on mining operations and mining business in the mining areas for which renewal applications have been made on the condition that the lessee pays to the Government dead rent from the date of commencement of the Abolition Act. Subsequently, this Court granted leave in the special leave petition and continued the aforesaid interim order.
The Justice Shah Commission and its report:
4. As reports were received from various State Governments of widespread mining of iron ore and manganese ore in contravention of the provisions of the MMDR Act, the Forests (Conservation) Act 1980, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and other rules and guidelines issued thereunder, the Central Government appointed the Justice Shah Commission under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 by notification dated 22.11.2010. Paras 2 and 3 of the notification, which are relevant, are extracted hereinbelow:
2. The terms of reference of the Commission shall be-
(i) to inquire into and determine the nature and extent of mining and trade and transportation, done illegally or without lawful authority, of iron ore and manganese ore, and the losses therefrom; and to identify, as far as possible, the persons, firms, companies and other that are engaged in such mining, trade and transportation of iron ore and manganese ore, done illegally or without lawful authority;
(ii) to inquire into and determine the extent to which the management, regulatory and monitoring systems have failed to deter, prevent, detect and punish offences relating to mining, storage, transportation, trade and export of such ore, done illegally or without lawful authority, and the persons responsible for the same;
(iii) to inquire into the tampering of official records, including records relating to land and boundaries, to facilitate illegal mining and identify, as far as possible, the persons responsible for such tampering; and
(iv) to inquire into the overall impact of such mining, trade transportation and export done illegally or without lawful authority, in terms of destruction of forest wealth, damage to the environment, prejudice to the livelihood and other rights of tribal people, forest dwellers and other persons in the mined areas, and the financial losses caused to the Central and State Governments.
3. The Commission shall also recommend remedial measures to prevent such mining, trade, transportation and export done illegally or without lawful authority.
The Justice Shah Commission visited Goa and issued notices under Section 4 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 calling for information from concerned authorities and the lessees and submitted its interim report on 15.3.2012 to the Ministry of Mines, Union of India. On 7.9.2012, the Justice Shah Commission Report on Goa was tabled in Parliament along with an Action Taken Report of the Ministry of Mines and on 10.9.2012 the State Government of Goa passed an order suspending all mining operations in the State of Goa with effect from 11.9.2012.
5. Pursuant to this order of the State Government, on 11.09.2012 and 12.09.2012 the District Magistrates of the State of Goa banned transportation of iron ore in their respective districts and the Director of Mines and Geology ordered for verification of mineral ore which was already extracted. On 13.9.2012, the Director of Mines and Geology, Government of Goa issued Show Cause Notices to 40 mining leases. On 14.9.2012, the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Union of India also directed that all Environmental Clearances granted to mines in the State of Goa be kept in abeyance.
6. On the basis of findings in the report of the Justice Shah Commission on illegal mining in the State of Goa, the Goa Foundation has filed Writ Petition (C) 435 of 2012 as Public Interest Litigation praying for directions to the Union of India and the State of Goa to take steps for termination of the mining leases of lessees involved in mining in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957, the Mineral Concessions Rules, 1960, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 as well as the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Goa Foundation has prayed that a direction be issued to the Respondents to prosecute all those who have committed offences under the different laws and are involved in the pilferage of State revenue through illegal mining activities in the State of Goa including the public servants who have aided and abetted the offences. The Goa Foundation has also sought for appointment of an independent authority with full powers to take control, supervise and regulate mining operations in the State of Goa and to ensure the implementation of the laws. Besides, the aforesaid main reliefs, the Goa Foundation has also prayed for some incidental and consequential reliefs. On 5.10.2012, this Court issued notice in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 435 of 2012 to the Respondents and directed the Central Empowered Committee (for short "CEC") to submit its report on the writ petition and also directed that till further orders, all mining operations in the leases identified in the report of the Justice Shah Commission and transportation of iron ore and manganese ore from those leases, whether lying at the mine-head or stockyards, shall remain suspended, as recommended in the report of the Justice Shah Commission.
7. Different mining lessees of the State of Goa and the Goa Mining Association also filed Writ Petitions in the Bombay High Court, Goa Bench for a declaration that the report of the Shah Commission is illegal and for quashing the findings in the report of the Justice Shah Commission and also for quashing the order dated 10.9.2012 of the Government of Goa suspending mining operations in the State of Goa and the order dated 14.9.2012 of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, directing that the Environmental Clearances granted to the mines in the State of Goa be kept in abeyance. These Writ Petitions have been transferred to this Court for hearing along with the hearing of Writ Petition (Civil) No. 435 of 2012 filed by the Goa Foundation.
8. The Writ Petitions and the Transferred Cases were heard during September, October and November, 2013. On 11th November, 2013, an order was passed by this Court directing that the inventory of the excavated mineral ores lying in different mines/stockyards/jetties/ports in the State of Goa made by the Department of Mines and Geology of the Government of Goa be verified and thereafter the whole of the inventorised mineral ores be sold by e-auction and the sale proceeds (less taxes and royalty) be retained in separate fixed deposits (lease-wise) by the State of Goa till the Court delivers the judgment in these matters on the legality of the leases from which the mineral ores were extracted. The Court has also directed that this entire process of verification of the inventory, e-auction and deposit of sale proceeds be monitored by a Monitoring Committee appointed by the Court. By the said order dated 11.11.2013, this Court also constituted an Expert Committee to conduct a macro EIA Study on what should be the ceiling of annual excavation of iron ore from the State of Goa considering its iron ore resources and its carrying capacity, keeping in mind the principles of sustainable development and inter-generational equity and all other relevant factors. On 11.11.2013 the case was also reserved for judgment.
Challenge to the Report of the Justice Shah Commission:
9. As we have already noticed, in the cases transferred from the Bombay High Court to this Court, the mining lessees have prayed for quashing the report of the Justice Shah Commission. Mr. K.K. Vengupal, learned senior Counsel appearing for the mining lessees, submitted that the Justice Shah Commission did not issue any notice under Section 8B of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 to the mining lessees giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in their defence. He further submitted that the Justice Shah Commission also did not permit the mining lessees to cross examine the witnesses, to address the Commission and to be represented by legal practitioners before the Commission contrary to the provisions of Section 8C of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. He submitted that even otherwise there is gross breach of the principles of natural justice and fair play by the Justice Shah Commission and, therefore, the report of the Commission was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. He submitted that the report of the Justice Shah Commission should, therefore, be quashed. In support of this submission, he relied on the decisions of this Court in Kiran Bedi v. Committee of Inquiry and Anr. [MANU/SC/0512/1989 : (1989) 1 SCC 494], State of Bihar v. L.K. Advani [MANU/SC/0716/2003 : (2003) 8 SCC 361] and Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel [MANU/SC/0373/1985 : 1985 (3) SCC 398].
10. Mr. Mohan Prasaran, learned Solicitor General for the Union of India, on the other hand, submitted that as the notification dated 22.11.2010 of the Central Government appointing the Justice Shah Commission under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 would show, reports were received from various State Governments of widespread mining of iron ore and manganese ore in contravention of the MMDR Act, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 or other Rules and Licenses issued thereunder and for this reason, the Central Government appointed the Justice Shah Commission for the purpose of making inquiry into these matters of public importance. He submitted that after the Justice Shah Commission submitted the report pointing out various illegalities, the Union Government has kept the environment clearances in abeyance and it will take legal action on the basis of its own assessment of the facts and not on the basis of the facts as found in the Justice Shah Commission's report. Similarly, Mr. Atmaram N.S. Nadkarni, the Advocate General appearing for the State of Goa, submitted that after going through the report of the Justice Shah Commission, the State Government has suspended all mining and transportation of ores and no legal action will be taken against the mining lessees on the basis of the findings in the Justice Shah Commission's report unless due opportunity is given to the mining lessees to place their defence against the findings of the Justice Shah Commission.
11. We find that Section 8B of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. 1952 provides that if a person is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry, the Commission shall give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard and to produce evidence in his defence and Section 8C of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 provides that every such person will have a right to cross-examine and the right to be represented by a legal practitioner before the Commission. As the State Government of Goa has taken a stand before us that no action will be taken against the mining lessees only on the basis of the findings in the report of the Justice Shah Commission without making its own assessment of facts and without first giving the mining lessees the opportunity of hearing and the opportunity to produce evidence in their defence, we are not inclined to quash the report of the Justice Shah Commission on the ground that the provisions of Sections 8B and 8C of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 and the principles of natural justice have not been complied with. At the same time, we cannot also direct prosecution of the mining lessees on the basis of the findings in the report of the Justice Shah Commission, if they have not been given the opportunity of being heard and to produce evidence in their defence and not allowed the right to cross-examine and the right to be represented by a legal practitioner before the Commission as provided in Sections 8B and 8C respectively of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. We will, however, examine the legal and environmental issues raised in the report of the Justice Shah Commission and on the basis of our findings on these issues consider granting the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition filed by Goa Foundation and the reliefs prayed for in the writ petitions filed by the mining lessees, which have been transferred to this Court.
Whether the leases held by the mining lessees have expired:
12. According to the Justice Shah Commission report, prior to 7th January, 1993, Sub-rule (4) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules provided that the renewal application of the lessee is required to be disposed of within six months from the date of its receipt and sub rule (5) of Rule 24A provided that if the application is not disposed of within stipulated time, the same shall be deemed to have been refused. The Justice Shah Commission has found that the applications of several mining leases for renewal were not disposed of within the stipulated time and there was no provision in the MC Rules to condone the delay and, therefore, these leases are in contravention of the MC Rules and are void and have no effect as provided in Section 19 of the MMDR Act.
13. The CEC in its report has stated that under Section 4 of the Abolition Act, the concessions were abolished from 23rd May, 1987 and treated as deemed leases under the MMDR Act and the period of deemed leases under Section 5 of the Abolition Act was extended upto six months with effect from the date of assent to the Abolition Act (23rd May, 1987) i.e. upto 22nd November, 1987. The CEC has further stated that by notifications dated 20th November, 1987 and 20th May, 1988, however, the Government of Goa allowed extension of six months each (totaling one year) for making applications for the first renewal of deemed mining leases and this one year period expired on 22nd November, 1988. The CEC has further stated that as per the information provided to the CEC, out of 595 mining concessions abolished and converted into deemed mining leases under Section 4 of the Abolition Act, as many as 379 deemed mining lease holders have filed applications for the first renewal of the mining leases before 22nd November, 1988 and 59 such leases have filed applications for the first renewal of the deemed mining leases after 22nd November, 1988, i.e., beyond the time limit permitted under Rule, 24A(8) of the MC Rules.
14. In reply, learned Counsel for the lessees and Mr. Arvind Datar, learned senior Counsel appearing for the State of Goa, submitted that Sub-rules (4) and (5) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules did not apply to the State of Goa. They submitted that Sub-rules (8) and (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules apply specifically to the State of Goa and Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules provides that an application for the first renewal of the deemed mining lease referred to in Section 4 of the Abolition Act shall be made to the State Government in Form 'J' before the period of six months of the mining lease as provided in Section 5(1) of the Abolition Act. They submitted that the proviso to Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules conferred power on the State Government to extend time for making such application upto a total period not extending one year. They submitted that, by two notifications, the State Government extended time for a period of one year upto 22.11.1988 and within this period most of the lessees have applied for the first renewal of the deemed mining lease. Learned Counsel for the lessees and learned Counsel for the State of Goa submitted that Sub-rule (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules makes it clear that if an application for first renewal is made within the time referred to in Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules or within the time allowed by the State Government under the proviso to Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules', the period of that lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a further period till the State Government passes orders thereon.
15. For easy reference, Chapter II containing Sections 4 and 5 of the Abolition Act is extracted hereinbelow:
CHAPTER II
ABOLITION OF MINING CONCESSIONS AND DECLARATION AS MINING LEASES UNDER THE MINES AND MINERALS ACT
4. (1) Every mining concession specified in the First Schedule shall, on and from the appointed day, be deemed to have been abolished, and shall, with effect from that day, be deemed to be a mining lease granted under the Mines and Minerals Act, and the provisions of that Act shall, save as otherwise provided in this Act, apply to such mining lease.
(2) Every mining concession specified in the Second Schedule shall, on and from the day next after the date of grant of the said concession and specified in the corresponding entry in the eighth column of the said Schedule, be deemed to have been abolished, and shall, with effect from that day, be deemed to be a mining lease granted under the Mines and Minerals Act, and the provisions of that Act shall, save as otherwise provided in this Act, apply to such mining lease.
(3) If, after the date of assent, the Central Government is satisfied, whether from any information received by it or otherwise, that there has been any error, omission or misdescription in relation to the particulars of any mining concession or the name and residence of any concession holder specified in the First or the Second Schedule, it may, by notification, correct such error, omission or misdescription, and on the issue of such notification, the First or the Second Schedule, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been amended accordingly.
5. (1) Where a mining concession has been deemed to be a mining lease under Section 4, the concession holder shall, on and from the day mentioned in that section, be deemed to have become the holder of such mining lease under the Mines and Minerals Act in relation to the mine to which the mining concession relates, subject to the condition that the period of such lease shall, notwithstanding anything contained in that Act, extend up to a period of six months from the date of assent.
(2) On the expiry of the period of any mining lease under Sub-section (1), it may, if so desired by the holder of such lease and on an application being made by him in accordance with the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Act and the rules made thereunder, be renewed on such terms and conditions, and up to the maximum period for which, such lease can be renewed under the provisions of that Act and the rules made thereunder.
16. For easy reference, Rule 24A of the MC Rules is also extracted hereinbelow:
24A. Renewal of mining lease.-(1) An application for the renewal of a mining lease shall be made to the State Government in Form J, at least twelve months before the date on which the lease is due to expire, through such officer or authority as the State Government may specify in this behalf.
(2) The renewal or renewals of a mining lease granted in respect of a mineral specified in Part 'A' and Part 'B' of the First Schedule to the Act may be granted by the State Government with the previous approval of the Central Government.;
(3) The renewal or renewals of a mining lease granted in respect of a mineral not specified in Part 'A' and Part 'B' of the First Schedule to the Act may be granted by the State Government.;
Provided that before granting approval for second or subsequent renewal of a mining lease, the State Government shall seek a report from the Controller General, Indian Bureau of Mines, as to whether it would be in the interest of mineral development to grant the renewal of the mining lease.
Provided further that in case a report is not received from Controller General, Indian Bureau of Mines in a period of three months of receipt of the communication from the State Government, it would be deemed that the Indian Bureau of Mines has no adverse comments to offer regarding the grant of the renewal of mining lease.
(4) An application for the renewal of a mining lease shall be disposed of within a period of six months from the date of its receipt. (Omitted)
(5) If an application is not disposed of within the period specified in Sub-rule (4) it shall be deemed to have been refused. (Omitted)
(6) If an application for the renewal of a mining lease made within the time referred to in Sub-rule (1) is not disposed of by the State Government before the date of expiry of the lease, the period of the lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a further period till the State Government passes order thereon.
(7) Omitted.
(8) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-rule (1) and Sub-rule (6), an application for the first renewal of a mining lease, so declared under the provisions of Section 4 of the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining Concession (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Lease) Act, 1987, shall be made to the State Government in Form J before the expiry of the period of mining lease in terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the said Act, through such office or authority as the State Government may specify in this behalf:
Provided that the State Government may, for reasons to be recorded in writing and subject to such conditions as it may think fit, allow extension of time for making of such application up to a total period not exceeding one year.
(9) If an application for first renewal made within the time referred to in Sub-rule (8) or within the time allowed by the State Government under the proviso to Sub-rule (8), the period of that lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a further period till the State Government passes orders thereon.
(10) The State Government may condone delay in an application for renewal of mining lease made after the time limit prescribed in Sub-rule (1) provided the application has been made before the expiry of the lease.
17. Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules has been inserted by G.S.R. 855(E), dated 14th October, 1987 and this Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-rule (1) and Sub-rule (6), an application for the first renewal of a deemed mining lease, referred to in Section 4 of the Abolition Act, shall be made to the State Government in Form J before the expiry of the six months period of deemed mining lease as provided in Section 5(1) of the Abolition Act. The proviso to Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules, however, empowers the State Government to extend the time for making such application upto a total period not extending one year. In exercise of these powers in the proviso to Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules, the State Government of Goa has, in fact, extended time for making applications for first renewal upto 22.11.1988, by two notifications dated 20.11.1987 and 20.05.1988. Sub-rule (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules, which was also inserted by G.S.R. 855(E), dated 14th October, 1987, reads as follows:
In an application for first renewal made within the time referred to in Sub-rule (8) or within the time allowed by the State Government under the proviso to Sub-rule (8), the period of that lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a period of one year from the date of expiry of lease or date of receipt of application, whichever is later, provided that the period of deemed extension of lease shall end with the date of receipt of the orders of the State Government thereon, if such orders are made earlier.
Sub-rule (9) was substituted by G.S.R. 724(E) dated 27th September, 1994 by the existing Sub-rule (9) (extracted above) to provide that if an application for first renewal is made within the time referred to in Sub-rule (8) or within the time allowed by the State Government under the proviso to Sub-rule (8), the period of that lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a further period till the State Government passes orders thereon. In our considered opinion, the intention of rule-making authorities is very clear from Sub-rule (9) as was originally inserted by G.S.R. 855(E), dated 14th October, 1987 and Sub-rule (9) as was substituted by G.S.R. 724(E), dated 27th September, 1994, that until orders were passed by the State Government on an application for first renewal of a lease filed by a lessee within the time allowed, the lease was deemed to have been extended.
18. The lessees have contended that they had filed their applications by 22.11.1988, i.e. the date up to which the State Government had allowed time under the proviso to Sub-rule (8) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules. The State Government has also taken the stand that most of the applications for first renewal were filed within the time allowed by the State Government and this stand is also supported by the facts found by the CEC. The result is that most of the mining leases in which the State Government has not passed orders are deemed to have been extended under Sub-rule (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules. Hence, the finding in the Justice Shah Commission report that the applications for renewal were not disposed of within the stipulated time and the leases are in contravention of the MC Rules is, thus, not correct. This opinion of the Justice Shah Commission, as we have noticed, was based on Sub-rules (4) and (5) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules, which were applicable generally to an application for renewal of mining leases, stood excluded to the extent specific provisions have been subsequently made by the rule-making authorities in Sub-rules (8) and (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules in respect of the deemed leases in Goa.
19. Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned Counsel for the Goa Foundation, however, submitted that Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act prior to its amendment provided that a mining lease may be renewed for only ten years and, therefore, if the deemed mining leases of the lessees expired on 22.11.1987, even if the lease was renewed on the application of first renewal made by the lessees in Goa, the period of lease under the first renewal would expire on 21.11.1997 and after 21.11.1997, there can be no deemed extension. Alternatively, he submitted that Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act as amended by Act 25 of 1994 provided that the mining lease may be renewed for a maximum period not exceeding twenty years. He submitted that as the deemed mining leases expired on 22.11.1987, the lessees would be entitled to a renewal for a maximum period of twenty years upto 21.11.2007 and after 21.11.2007, the lessees would not be entitled to any renewal and hence the lessees were not entitled to operate the lease beyond 21.11.2007.
20. Learned Counsel for the lessees, on the other hand, submitted that Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act makes it clear that notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act, the State Government can authorise renewal of a mining lease in respect of minerals not specified in Part A and Part B of the First Schedule for a further period or periods not exceeding twenty years in each case. They submitted that iron ore is specified in Part C in the First Schedule and hence the State Government can authorise renewal of the mining lease in respect of iron ore for a period or periods not exceeding twenty years in each case. They also referred to Sub-rule (3) of Rule 24A which provided that renewal or renewals of a mining lease granted in respect of a mineral not specified in Part A and Part B of the First Schedule to the MMDR Act may be granted by the State Government provided that before granting approval for second or subsequent renewal of a mining lease, the State Government shall seek a report from the Controller General, Indian Bureau of Mines, as to whether it would be in the interest of mineral development to grant the renewal of the mining lease. Learned Counsel for the lessees submitted that as the application of the lessees for renewal of mining leases have not been disposed of by the State Government before the date of expiry of lease, the period of lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a further period till the State Government passes orders thereon as provided in Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules. They submitted that it will be clear from Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules that the intention of rule-making authorities is that there may not be any hiatus in mining, and mineral development in the country may continue without break, without any loss to the economy and loss of revenue to the Government. They cited the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. and Ors. v. Lalji Tandon (dead) through L.Rs. [MANU/SC/0861/2003 : (2004) 1 SCC 1], in which this Court has held that there is a difference between an extension of lease and renewal of lease and whereas in the case of extension of lease it is not necessary to have a fresh deed of lease executed, in case of renewal of lease, a fresh deed of lease shall have to be executed between the parties. They also cited Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. Union of India and Anr. [MANU/SC/0623/1996 : (1996) 9 SCC 709] in support of their argument that under Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act, the Government can renew the mining lease for a further period if it was in the interest of mineral development.
21. Mr. Nadkarni, learned Advocate General for the State of Goa, submitted that the then State Government of Goa allowed the working of the mines from 2007 till 2012 based on deemed extension status but it has been decided by the State Government now in the Goa Mining Policy of 2013 that no mine can be allowed on deemed extension basis. The clear stand of the State Government of Goa in the resume of arguments filed by the learned Advocate General Mr. Nadkarni is that the deemed extension status would not mean that a mine can be allowed to run indefinitely without a decision on the renewal application.
22. Section 8 of the MMDR Act is extracted hereinbelow:
8. Periods for which mining leases may be granted or renewed
(1) The maximum period for which a mining lease may be granted shall not exceed thirty years:
Provided that the minimum period for which any such mining lease may be granted shall not be less than twenty years;
(2) A mining lease may be renewed for a period not exceeding twenty years]:
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2), if the State Government is of opinion that in the interests of mineral development it is necessary so to do, it may, for reasons to be recorded, authorise the renewal of a mining lease in respect of minerals not specified in Part A and Part B of the First Schedule for a further period or periods not exceeding twenty years in each case.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (3), no mining lease granted in respect of mineral specified in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule shall be renewed except with the previous approval of the Central Government.
23. Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act, which provides the maximum and minimum periods for which a mining lease may be granted will not apply to deemed mining leases in Goa because Sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Abolition Act provides that the period of such deemed mining leases will extend upto six months from the date of assent notwithstanding anything contained in the MMDR Act. In other words, notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act, the period of a deemed mining lease in Goa was to expire on 22.11.1987 (six months from the date of assent). Under Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act, a mining lease may be renewed for a period not exceeding twenty years. Sub-section (3) of Section 8, however, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2), if the State Government is of the opinion that in the interest of mineral development, it is necessary so to do, it may for reasons to be recorded, authorise the renewal of a mining lease in respect of minerals not specified in Part A and Part B of the First Schedule for a further period or periods not exceeding twenty years in each case. Thus, renewal beyond the first renewal for a period of twenty years is conditional upon the State Government forming an opinion that in the interest of mineral development, it is necessary to do so and also conditional upon the State Government recording reasons for such renewal of a mining lease in respect of iron ore which is not specified in Part A and Part B of the First Schedule. In Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. Union of India and Anr. (supra), this Court has held that the language of Sub-section (3) of Section 8 is quite clear that ordinarily a lease is not to be granted beyond the time specified in Sub-section (2) and only if the Government is of the view that it would be in the interest of mineral development, it is empowered to renew lease of a lessee for a further period after recording sound reasons for doing so. This Court has further held in the aforesaid case that this measure has been incorporated in the legislative scheme as a safeguard against arbitrariness and the letter and spirit of the law must be adhered to in a strict manner.
24. The MC Rules have been made under Section 13 of the MMDR Act by the Central Government and obviously could not have been made in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules provides that if an application for the renewal of a mining lease made within the time referred to in Sub-rule (1) is not disposed of by the State Government before the date of expiry of the lease, the period of the lease shall be deemed to have been extended by a further period till the State Government passes order thereon. This sub-rule cannot apply to a renewal under Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act because the renewal under this provision cannot be made without express orders of the State Government recording reasons for renewal in the interest of mineral development. In other words, so long as there is a right of renewal in the lessee which in the case of a mining lease is for a maximum period of twenty years, the provision regarding deemed extension of a lease can operate, but if the right of renewal of a mining lease is dependent upon the State Government forming an opinion that in the interest of mineral development it is necessary to do so and the State Government recording reasons therefor, a provision regarding deemed extension till orders are passed by the State Government on the application of renewal cannot apply. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules will apply to a case of first renewal under Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act other than a case covered under Sub-rule (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules, but will not apply to renewal under Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act. In our view, the deemed mining leases of the lessees in Goa expired on 22.11.1987 under Sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Abolition Act and the maximum of 20 years renewal period of the deemed mining leases in Goa as provided in Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the MMDR Act read with Sub-rules (8) and (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules expired on 22.11.2007.
