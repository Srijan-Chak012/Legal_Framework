Case Note:
(i) Constitution - validity of provision - Articles 14, 19 and 21 of Constitution of India and Section 10 (3) (c) of Passports Act, 1967 - validity of Section 10 (3) (c) challenged - procedure in Article 21 means procedure which conforms to principles of natural justice - power conferred under Section 10 (3) (c) not unguided and it is implied in it that rules of natural justice would be applicable - held, Section 10 (3) (c) not violative of Article 21.

(ii) Right of dignity - right to live is not merely confined to physical existence - it includes within its ambit right to live with human dignity.

(iii) Inter-relationship - principle of reasonableness provided under Article 14 must apply to procedure as contemplated under Article 21 - Article 21 controlled by Article 19 also - in case a law does not infringe Article 21 even then it has to meet challenges of Articles 14 and 19.

(iv) Post-decisional hearing - petitioner's passport impounded and not given pre-decisional notice and hearing - Government contended that rule audi alteram partem must be excluded because it may have frustrated very purpose of impounding passport - concept of post-decisional hearing developed to maintain balance between administrative efficiency and fairness to individual - Court stressed that fair opportunity of being heard following immediately Order impounding passport would satisfy mandate of natural justice.

JUDGMENT
Authored By : M. Hameedullah Beg, Y.V. Chandrachud, P.N. Bhagwati, V.R. Krishna Iyer, P.S. Kailasam
M. Hameedullah Beg, C.J.
1. The case before us involves questions relating to basic human rights. On such questions I believe that multiplicity of views giving the approach of each member of this Court is not a disadvantage if it clarifies our not infrequently differing approaches. It should enable all interested to appreciate better the significance of our Constitution.
2. As I am in general agreement with my learned brethren Bhagwati and Krishna Iyer. I will endeavour to confine my observations to an indication of my own approach on some matters for consideration now before us. This seems to me to be particularly necessary as my learned brother Kailasam, who has also given us the benefit of his separate opinion, has a somewhat different approach. I have had the advantage of going through the opinions of each of my three learned brethren.
3. It seems to me that there can be little doubt that the right to travel and to go outside the country, which orders regulating issue, suspension or impounding, and cancellation of passports directly affect, must be included in rights to "personal liberty" on the strength of decisions of this Court giving a very wide ambit to the right to personal liberty (see : Satwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer, Government of India, New Delhi and Ors. MANU/SC/0040/1967 : [1967]3SCR525 , Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0085/1962 : 1963CriLJ329 .
4. Article 21 of the Constitution reads as follows :
Protection of life and personal liberty. No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.
