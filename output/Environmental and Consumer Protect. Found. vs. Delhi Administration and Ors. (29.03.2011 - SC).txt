CHHATTISGARH:
4. The Chief Secretary of the State of Chhattisgarh has filed an affidavit annexing therewith a chart, in which it is indicated that there are total number of 47,141 primary and upper primary schools in the State. Out of them drinking water facility is available in 38,022 schools whereas the remaining 9,119 schools do not have drinking water facility. Similarly, toilet facility is available in 27,415 schools whereas 19,726 schools are without toilets; 12,484 schools have electricity whereas 34,657 schools are without electricity; 9,955 schools have boundary walls whereas in 37,186 schools there is no boundary wall.

Similarly, the sanctioned strength of the Assistant Teachers/SKG-3 is 89,768 while the working strength is 82,728 and the vacancies are to the tune of 740.

The Chief Secretary is directed to file a further affidavit on or before 30th June, 2011. We make it clear that no further time will be granted for this purpose. KEARLA:

4. In pursuance of the above judgment the details regarding basic facilities such as water, toilets, urinals, electricity, boundary walls, mid-day meal facility and requisite number of teachers of the primary schools in the State of Kerala is submitted below.
5. In the Central Government pattern the primary section includes classes upto 8th standard. However in the State of Kerala, the 8th standard comes under Secondary section. Primary and secondary sections are functioning together in the same schools and compound, in majority of places. As such it is difficult to furnish the details of the basic facilities such as water, urinals, toilets etc. provided in the primary section separately. Hence, the details furnished include both the primary and secondary section.
6. As per the existing norms, the total requirement of toilets in Government and Aided schools in the State comes to 37,334 and that of urinals is 97,112. Out of the 37,334 numbers of toilets required, 34,833 numbers were completed. The construction of 628 numbers of toilets is in progress and the construction of balance 1,873 numbers is to be taken up. Out of the 97,112 numbers of urinals required, 81,474 numbers were completed and the construction of 3,597 numbers is in progress and the remaining 12,042 numbers is to be taken up. It may be noted that 3,597 numbers of toilets were constructed, covering 2,882 schools under the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in the State. Also under the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) an additional number for 3,662 toilets were proposed, covering 1,294 schools. Providing girl friendly toilets and urinals with running water in Government schools in minority concentrated areas is also being implemented by Suchitwa Mission with the financial assistance of Minority Affairs Department of the State in the schools of minority dominated areas. These works are proposed to be completed before 31.5.2011. The construction of 610 numbers of toilets and 1608 urinals are under progress under the above scheme.
7. There are no schools in the State with absolutely no urinal or latrine facility in the State; though some schools don't have enough number of units commensurate to the strength of the students.
8. Sufficient water facility is available in all the Government/Aided schools in the State.
9. As far as the electricity is concerned all the primary schools in the State have electric connection except in 277 schools.
10. In the State there are 2,047 Nos. of schools having pucca boundary walls. There are 897 numbers of schools have boundary walls which are damaged and requires maintenance. There are 38 numbers of schools having barbed wire fencing. There are 593 numbers of schools, which are having no boundary walls. There are 1,155 numbers of schools which are having primary built boundary walls. In 88 numbers of schools the construction of boundary walls is in progress.
11. In the State, mid day meal scheme is implemented in primary section of all schools, with kitchen-shed facility.
12. All the schools in the primary section of the State are having the requisite number of teachers.
9. On the whole, the condition of the schools in the State of Kerala seems to be better as compared to the other States. However, we direct the State to augment the remaining facilities in the primary and upper primary schools, within three months from today and affidavit in this regard may be filed by the Chief Secretary of the State on or before 30th June, 2011.
WEST BENGAL:
10. In pursuance of the directions of this Court, the Chief Secretary to the Government of West Bengal has filed an affidavit, relevant paragraphs of which are extracted hereunder:
5. Based on updated information, kept and maintained by the Government of West Bengal, it is stated that across the nineteen districts including Kolkata, spreading the State of West Bengal, 50,169 recognized aided primary schools exist. Out of those 50,169 primary schools, potable drinking water facility is available in 50,008 primary schools; toilets are available in 49,441 primary schools; electricity in 12,076 primary schools; mid-day meal facilities are available in 46,625 primary schools and boundary wall is there in 15,904 primary schools. Similarly, out of 10,799 recognized aided upper primary schools in West Bengal, 10,295 are having potable drinking water facility; 9,578 are having toilets; 8,122 are having electricity; 5,497 are having kitchen shed and 6599 recognized aided primary schools are having boundary walls. As per Section 19(2) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the State Government has already drawn up a plan for increasing such facilities in schools which do not have any of the above facilities within a period of 3 (three) years from the commencement of the Act, i.e. 31/03/2013.
6. Based on upgraded information, kept and maintained by the Government of West Bengal, it is further stated that in 50,169 numbers of primary schools there are 61,90,157 students who are prosecuting their studies at the primary level. There is at present sanctioned posts of 1,98,682 primary school teachers; additionally there is also sanctioned posts of 25,781 para teachers at the primary level. Thus, the State does have the sanctioned posts of the required numbers of teachers as per requirement specified under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In fact the sanctioned strength of regular primary teachers far exceeds such requirement. However, it may also be stated that out of the total 1,98,682 numbers of sanctioned posts of teachers in primary schools, about 68,000 posts had fallen vacant in recent past and could not be filled up during 2005-2009 due to various pending litigations. The State Government has, however, taken steps in August 2009 to fill up the vacant posts of teachers in primary schools and about 49,886 numbers of vacant posts of teachers have since been filled up and remaining vacancies are expected to be filled up shortly.
7. Similarly, at the upper primary level for the purpose of teaching 56,71,000 students in 10,799 numbers of existing schools, there is a sanctioned strength of 1,22,684 post of regular teachers. Additionally, 27,949 para teachers are also there to teach such students. Under the standards set up b the said Act of 2009, 1,62,061 regular teachers are required to teach 56,71,000 students in the upper primary level in West Bengal. From these figures it is evident that the umber of sanctioned posts is slightly lower than the required number of teachers in terms of the said Act of 2009 at the upper primary level. However, the State Government has already taken steps to increase the sanctioned posts of regular teachers at the upper primary level by another 39,510. It may also be stated here that sanction has already been accorded to set up additional 5,676 upper primary schools throughout the State. Out of this, 4,031 upper primary schools have already been set up. The State Government has also sanctioned total 12,093 new posts of teachers for the aforesaid 4,013 newly set up upper primary schools. The additional requirement of teaching posts for the existing and the newly set up upper primary schools as per Right to Education Act, 2009 comes to 39,510. The State Government has already taken steps to create additional 39,510 posts of Assistant Teacher for existing and newly set up upper primary schools across the State to meet the statutory obligations under the Right to Education Act, 2009. It may also be stated here that the Government of India has already relaxed the time limit for filling up the vacant posts of teachers as required under Section 25(1) of the Right to Education Act, 2009.
11. We direct the State to augment the basic infrastructural facilities in the schools and an affidavit, giving therein the details of the infrastructural facilities provided in the schools, be filed by the Chief Secretary on or before 30th June, 2011. It is made clear that no further time for this purpose shall be granted.

In these remote areas, power supply has not been extended or is available only during evening hours when the schools are not in operation.
12. That with regard to the supply of cooked mid day meals (MDM), the benefit is extended to 311 schools (304 Govt. schools, 02 Govt. Aided Schools and 05 Local body schools). Out of 307 Govt. schools, MDM scheme is implemented in 304 schools; the remaining 03 schools are not covered under this scheme as these schools have no primary and upper primary classes attached. Other than this, in this UT cooked MDM is also extended to 36 Alternative Innovative Education (AIE) and Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) centres.
13. That in the UT of A & N Islands, the MDM scheme is outsourced through the Self Help Groups, Mahila Mandals, Registered Women Cooperative Societies and Individuals. At most places, mid day meals are cooked in their respective kitchens and the cooked MDM is transported to the respective schools. Supervision and monitoring of cooking process and distribution to ascertain hygienic condition is continuously being done by the school level MDM Committees, Block level Committees and District level Committees. Mid Day Meals in every school is cooked and supplied as per the weekly menu prepared by the respective school MDM committees. To ascertain the nutritional value of the cooked MDM in conformity with the guidelines issued by the Govt. of India, the services of external agencies such as; Health Department, Home Science Department of the Govt. College (JNRM) Port Blair are also availed periodically.
14. 32 Schools of UT Administration have permanent kitchen-cum-Store facility. Proposal for construction of 244 (excluding 28 schools which are in the reserved forest area) MDM kitchen-cum-Store had been sent to the Ministry of Human Resources, Govt. Of India (MHRD) for the sanction of fund. MHRD had asked us to submit revised estimates for construction of permanent kitchen-cum-Store for these 244 schools. During the year 2008-09 MHRD released an amount of ` 165.60 lacs towards the cost of construction of 276 Nos. of kitchen-cum-Stores at the rate of ` 60,000/- per unit cost for A & N Islands. Considering the market price index of this UT as PWD code, the construction of kitchen sheds at the rate of ` 60,000/- per unit is not feasible. Thus this UT Administration requested MHRD vide this office letter No. 7-&&/Edn./PS/2008-09/755 dt. 12/02/2009 to enhance the unit construction cost to ` 4.5 lacs per unit or 7.5 times of the sanctioned costs.
15. MHRD vide its letter No. 1-1/2009-Desk (MDM) dtd. 31/12/2009 directed this UT Admn. to submit the area requirement of kitchen-cum-Stores to be worked out as prescribed by the MHRD. Accordingly the Directorate of Education vide letter No. 6-227/Edn./MDM/Coress/2009-10/181 dtd. 18/01/2010 submitted a detailed proposal of ` 16.5 crores for construction of 244 kitchen-cum-Stores in Primary & Upper Primary Schools of this UT. In response to which MHRD had issued a L.O.A. for an amount of d 45.09 lakhs as 75% contribution towards the construction of 05 Kitchen Sheds which was received by this office on 22/03/2010. Since there was no time available to utilise the same within that financial year as such, the funds were surrendered vide letter No. 6-227/Edn./MDM/Coress/2009-10/2745 dtd. 31/03/2010. However the Ministry has again asked this UT to submit revised estimate for construction of 244 Kitchen cum Stores. Revised estimates are being prepared for inclusion of the same in Annual Work Plan Budget (AWP & B), 2011-12.
16. In order to ensure the safety of students and the structural assets during any fire hazards, installation work of the fire fighting equipments in 130 Govt. Schools are in progress. The remaining 177 schools would be covered in a phased manner in the subsequent Annual Plans.
17. That out of 307 schools, only 155 schools have playground facilities. Due to the paucity of land under revenue areas, the remaining schools could not be provided with playground facilities. However, efforts are on for seeking allotment of land near the schools for development of playground wherever possible. Moreover, mini stadia, available at 08 places, with one more under construction, are also being used for sports and games activities of a number of schools located nearby.
24. We are very happy that the Chief Secretary has dealt with all the relevant issues in the said affidavit. We appreciate the learned Chief Secretary's submitting comprehensive picture of primary education in the State of Andaman and Nicobar.
