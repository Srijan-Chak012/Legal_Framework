Case Note:
Education - Incomplete application - Section 10A Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 - Petitioner filed application to increase number of MBBS seats for academic year 2015-2015 - Incomplete application made either one day prior to deadline for applications or one day after - Essentiality certificate not issued by state government and not filed with application - Certificate filed four days after application - Application rejected by Respondents - Incomplete application made outside the deadline for applications - Petitioner sought direction for inspection from High Court - Single Bench of High Court allowed Petitioners application in April, 2015 - Set aside on appeal by the Respondents - Whether the Respondents should have condoned the Petitioner's delay in filing the application - Whether the Court can direct inspection of the Petitioner by the Respondent for the academic year 2015-2016

Facts

The Petitioner, a medical college sought to increase the number of seats in the MBBS course from 150 to 250 from the academic session 2015-2016. The Petitioner claimed it had filed the application for increase in the intake capacity on 30.8.2014. The essentiality certificate was not submitted as it had not been issued to it by the state government. The certificate was issued on 3.9.2014 and was submitted to the Respondents on 5.9.2014. On 16.10.2014 the Respondents returned the application on the ground that the essentiality certificate and the consent of affiliation were not submitted by the Petitioner along with the proposal dated 1.9.2014. The last date of submitting the duly completed application was over on 31.8.2014. The Petitioner was advised to submit a fresh application for the academic year 2016-17. On 24.10.2014, the Petitioner requested for condonation of delay in submitting the essentiality certificate and thereafter, it filed a writ application which was allowed on 8.4.2015 by the Single Bench of the High Court. On 17.4.2015, the MCI filed an appeal against the judgment and order passed by the Single Bench was set aside. Hence, the present petition.

Held, dismissing the petition

1.It was laid down in Dental Council of India v. S.R.M. Institute of Science and Technology and Anr. that incomplete applications cannot even be processed by the Respondents. From Royal Medical Trust (Regd.) v. Union of India and Anr. it is ascertained that the application at the first instance is required to be complete and incomplete applications are liable to be rejected. In the instant case, the application was incomplete when it was filed. Even assuming that the application was filed before 31.8.2014, it was an incomplete application as the essentiality certificate issued by the state government was not enclosed along with the application form.[8],[15] and[16]

2.The time schedule which has statutory force, has been ordered to be strictly adhered. In Mridul Dhar (Minor) and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. it was laid down that for establishment of new medical colleges/increase in intake capacity, application should be filed within the prescribed period and only such applications which are complete in all respects, have to be treated as applications under Section 10A of the Act, 1956. The time schedule is required to be strictly observed. It would not be appropriate to issue any direction for consideration of Petitioner's case for the ongoing academic session 2015-16 in which inspection is yet to be made, and is too late. Any relaxation in the time schedule would make holding of examinations on an all India basis a farce and several complications would arise. The power given to Respondents to relax can be exercised in exceptional circumstances and that too without disturbing the academic session. The decision-making process after inspection has various steps and it cannot be ordered to be done in haste. The statutory time schedule is over and it would not be appropriate to direct inspection to be made and thereafter a decision to be taken for the current academic session 2015-16. The application which has been submitted by the Petitioner be considered for the next academic session, subject to fulfilment of other requisite formalities.[11],[20] and[23]

JUDGMENT
Arun Mishra, J.
1. The Petitioner has filed the present special leave petition aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 5.5.2015 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in L.P.A. No. 235/2015 thereby reversing the judgment and order passed by the Single Bench in the matter of increase of seats for MBBS course from 150 to 250 from the academic session 2015-16. The Petitioner preferred writ petition before the Single Bench of the High Court of Delhi on being aggrieved by the rejection of its application by the Central Government on the ground that essentiality certificate was not filed along with the application form. The Petitioner claimed that it had filed the application for increase in the intake capacity on 30.8.2014. The essentiality certificate could not be submitted by the Petitioner as it had not been issued to it by the Government of Maharashtra. It was issued on 3.9.2014 and was submitted to the Central Government on 5.9.2014. On 16.10.2014 the Central Government returned the application on the ground that the essentiality certificate and the consent of affiliation were not submitted by the Petitioner along with the proposal dated 1.9.2014. The last date of submitting the duly completed application was over on 31.8.2014. The Petitioner was advised to submit a fresh application for the academic year 2016-17. On 24.10.2014, the Petitioner requested for condonation of delay in submitting the essentiality certificate. Thereafter, the Petitioner filed a writ application which was allowed vide order dated 8.4.2015 by the Single Bench of the High Court. On 17.4.2015, the Medical Council of India (for short "the MCI") filed a Letters Patent Appeal No. 235/2015 as against the judgment and order passed by the Single Bench which was allowed vide judgment and order dated 5.5.2015. Hence, the Petitioner has assailed the same in the present special leave petition.
2. A Division Bench of the High Court has, inter alia, relied upon a decision of this Court in Educare Charitable Trust v. Union of India and Anr. [MANU/SC/0958/2013 : AIR 2014 SC 902] and held that for the present academic session 2015-16, no direction can be issued due to time schedule.
It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that once the essentiality certificate was submitted by it, the application could not have been returned/rejected in a mechanical manner due to the aforesaid deficiency and the delay ought to have been condoned. In the circumstances, as delay was occasioned by the Government of Maharashtra, it was beyond the control of the Petitioner. Illegality has been committed in rejecting the Petitioner's prayer to condone the delay on the ground that essentiality certificate was not submitted within the prescribed time limit. Reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court in S.L.P. [C] No. 14838/2015 -Ponnaiyah Ramajayam Institute of Science and Technology Trust v. MCI and Anr. decided on 15.7.2015, C.A. No. 8054/2013 -Royal Medical Trust (Regd.) v. Union of India and Anr. decided on 10.9.2013; and W.P. [C] No. 414/2015 -Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr. ordered on 7.8.2015.
3. Per contra, it was contended on behalf of the Respondents that the MCI is a statutory body and is governed by the Act and the rules and also by the directions issued by this Court for strict adherence to the time schedule and it has an obligation towards maintenance of highest standards of medical education. Time schedule and Regulations are binding and mandatory. Under Section 10A of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act of 1956") prior permission of the Central Government for establishing any medical college or starting any higher course of study has to be obtained. Increase in the intake capacity is governed by "The Opening of a New or Higher Course of Study or Training (including Post-graduate Course of Study or Training) and Increase of Admission Capacity in any Course of Study or Training (including a Postgraduate Course of Study or Training) Regulations, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as "the Regulations of 2000"). The Regulations require the essentiality certificate to be necessarily appended to the application form.
4. It is also submitted by the MCI that the criteria set out in the Establishment of Medical College Regulations, 1999 is also required to be fulfilled. The schedule thereof prescribes the time schedule. The rejection of the application is appropriate as incomplete applications cannot be entertained. Time schedule is required to be observed as held by this Court in umpteen number of decisions and now if any inspection is ordered, it can be only for the academic year 2016-17 and not for the academic session 2015-16. The decision-making process not only involves inspection but the decision by other competent bodies of the MCI and, thereafter, by the Central Government. The decision of the Respondents is just and proper, no case for interference is made out in breach of time-schedule to make the inspection for the academic session 2015-16.
5. Section 10A of the Act of 1956 mandates prior permission to be obtained from the Medical Council of India/Government of India to establish new medical colleges/opening of a new or higher course of study/increase in the admission capacity. Various factors have been specified in Section 10A(7) which are to be taken into consideration by the MCI while making its recommendations to the Central Government. The Regulations of 2000 have been framed in exercise of power Under Section 10A read with Section 23 of the Act of 1956. Regulation 1 requires an application to be filed before the Central Government with permission of the State Government. Regulation 3 deals with the qualification criteria. Regulation 3(2) requires the permission letter regarding desirability and feasibility of having an increase in the existing medical college/institution, which has to be obtained by the applicant from the respective State Government/Union Territory Administration. Regulations 1, 3, 4 and 6 are extracted hereunder:
SCHEME FOR PERMISSION OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THE ADMISSION CAPACITY IN ANY COURSE OF STUDY OR TRAINING (INCLUDING POST GRADUATE COURSE OF STUDY OR TRAINING) IN THE EXISTING MEDICAL COLLEGES/INSTITUTIONS.
1. INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MEDICAL COLLEGE/INSTITUTION:

Appendix to format of application for permission makes it clear that an attested copy of essentiality certificate is required to be enclosed with the application form so as to make it complete. It is also apparent from Regulation 6 that the time schedule included in the Establishment of New Medical College Regulations, 1999 (for short "the 1999 Regulations") is applicable for increase in the intake capacity also.
7. The 1999 Regulations, as amended in 2012, prescribe different dates in its time schedule which are extracted below:
1. (i) These Regulations may be called the "Establishment of Medical College Regulations (Amendment), 2012.
(ii) They shall come into force from the date of their publication in the Official Gazette"....
6. In the "ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAL COLLEGE REGULATIONS, 1999", in "SCHEDULE FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW MEDICAL COLLEGES AND PROCESSING OF THE APPLICATIONS BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MEDICAL COUNCIL of INDIA", the following shall be substituted as under:
SCHEDULE FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW MEDICAL COLLEGES AND PROCESSING OF THE APPLICATIONS BY THE MEDICAL COUNCIL OF INDIA.

(2) Renewal of permission shall not be granted to a medical college if the above schedule for opening a medical college is not adhered to and admissions shall not be made without prior approval of the Central Government.
It is apparent that the application is required to be submitted to the Central Government from 1st to 31st August and thereafter the applications, which are in order, are to be forwarded by the Central Government to the MCI and the MCI, in turn, is required to send its recommendations and the Central Government has to issue a Letter of Intent by 30th of April next year. The applicant has to send reply to the Central Government by 31st May. For issue of letter of permission by the Council last date was 15.6.2015.
8. Reliance has been placed by the MCI on Dental Council of India v. S.R.M. Institute of Science and Technology and Anr. [MANU/SC/0301/2004 : (2004) 9 SCC 676] in which this Court has laid down that an incomplete application cannot be entertained. This Court held thus:
10. In this case, the High Court made an interim order to complete the processing of the application including inspection even in the absence of the permission or essentiality certificate from the State Government in terms of the Regulations framed by the Dental Council of India. The process of the courts or the process of law should not be allowed to subvert the law. In cases of recognition of dental colleges or starting of higher courses, this Court has in several cases including Islamic Academy of Education v. State of Karnataka [MANU/SC/0580/2003 : 2003 (6) SCC 697], State of Maharashtra v. Indian Medical Assn. [MANU/SC/0773/2001 : 2002 (1) SCC 589] etc. held that they are of mandatory character and have got to be complied with. When that is the position in law, the High Court ought not to have made an interim order to process the application even in the absence of the permission or essentiality certificate because the application will not be complete without being accompanied by permission or essentiality certificate by the State Government along with certain other documents. An incomplete application cannot be processed either by the Central Government or the Dental Council. The argument advanced on behalf of the Respondents will set at naught the law that in certain cases the courts need not insist on production of permission or essentiality certificate of the State Government, particularly, when the Regulations insist upon the same. To decide such a matter even in the absence of the Dental Council and the State Government as if they have no role to play in the matter is only to bypass the law, when statutory duties have been assigned and each one of those authorities has got a separate role to play. It may be that the Government of India takes the ultimate decision in the matter but to state that these authorities only aid the Government of India and hence it is not necessary to make them a party to the proceedings is not at all appropriate or acceptable to us. However, that would not be the end of the matter. In the present case, pursuant to the interim direction issued by the High Court, inspection has taken place and a report has been submitted by an inspection team appointed by the Dental Council of India which is kept in a sealed cover by the Dental Council of India. It would be more appropriate to process the application on the first Respondent furnishing the permission or essentiality certificate and other relevant documents as provided under the relevant Regulations and the scheme framed for the purpose of filing an application for starting a new or higher course in the college. On furnishing such permission or essentiality certificate, the Dental Council and the Government of India shall take appropriate steps as provided under the relevant Act and Rules or Regulations. Shri. P.P. Rao submits that a time of eight weeks may be granted to furnish the permission or essentiality certificate to the Government of India. We, therefore, direct that if such permission or essentiality certificate issued by the State Government is furnished within a period of eight weeks, the proposal of the first Respondent for starting new/higher courses shall be processed by the Dental Council of India and the Government of India and appropriate orders made thereon within eight weeks thereafter.
