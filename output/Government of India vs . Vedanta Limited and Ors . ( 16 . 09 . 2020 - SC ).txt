Facts:

The present appeal pertains to order passed by Delhi High Court allowing enforcement of foreign award. The Arbitration - Foreign Award - Enforceability - Time barred - Section 47 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Articles  136  and 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 - Parties had executed Production Sharing Agreement (PSC)  to commercially explore and develop the Ravva Oil and Gas Field - PSC was for a period of 25 years, and the development and exploration of the Ravva Field was to be conducted in terms of the 'Ravva Development Plan' - Dispute between the Parties emanates from Article 15 of the PSC which  provided for the recoverability of Base Development Costs ("BDC") incurred by the Respondents-Claimants for the development of the Ravva Field -Disputesrelating to costs and issue was referred for arbitration - Award was passed on 18.01.2011  in favour of the Respondent, which then moved an application for enforcing the award before the Delhi High Court - Application was allowed and government was directed to make the payments - Order confirming enforcement was challenged on the grounds of Limitation

Held, while dismissing the Appeals:

Theperiod of limitation for filing a petition for enforcement of a foreign award Under Sections 47 and 49, would be governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 which prescribes a period of three years from when the right to apply accrues.

The application Under Sections 47 and 49 for enforcement of the foreign award, is a substantive petition filed under the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is a well-settled position that the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code.5 The application Under Section 47 is not an application filed under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The application is filed before the appropriate High Court for enforcement, which would take recourse to the provisions of Order XXI of the CPC only for the purposes of execution of the foreign award as a deemed decree. The bar contained in Section 5, which excludes an application filed under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, would not be applicable to a substantive petition filed under the Arbitration Act, 1996. Consequently, a party may file an application under Section 5 for condonation of delay, if required in the facts and circumstances of the case.

In the facts of the present case, the Respondents submitted that after the Award dated 18.01.2011 was passed, the cost account statements were revised, and an amount of US $ 22 million was paid to the Government of India. On 10.07.2014, a show cause notice was issued to the Respondents, raising a demand of US $ 77 million, being the Government's share of Profit Petroleum under the PSC. It was contended that the cause of action for filing the enforcement petition Under Sections 47 and 49 arose on 10.07.2014. The enforcement petition was filed on 14.10.2014 i.e. within 3 months from the date when the right to apply accrued. The petition for enforcement of the foreign award was filed within the period of limitation prescribed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963. In any event, there are sufficient grounds to condone the delay, if any, in filing the enforcement/execution petition Under Sections 47 and 49, on account of lack of clarity with respect to the period of limitation for enforcement of a foreign award.

The enforcement Court cannot set aside a foreign award, even if the conditions Under Section 48 are made out. The power to set aside a foreign award vests only with the court at the seat of arbitration, since the supervisory or primary jurisdiction is exercised by the curial courts at the seat of arbitration. The enforcement court may "refuse" enforcement of a foreign award, if the conditions contained in Section 48 are made out. This would be evident from the language of the Section itself, which provides that enforcement of a foreign award may be "refused" only if the Applicant furnishes proof of any of the conditions contained in Section 48 of the Act.

The opening words of Section 48 use permissive, rather than mandatory language, that enforcement "may be" refused. The use of the words "may be" indicate that even if the party against whom the award is passed, proves the existence of one or more grounds for refusal of enforcement, the court would retain a residual discretion to overrule the objections, if it finds that overall justice has been done between the parties, and may direct the enforcement of the award. This is generally done where the ground for refusal concerns a minor violation of the procedural Rules applicable to the arbitration, or if the ground for refusal was not raised in the arbitration. A court may also take the view that the violation is not such as to prevent enforcement of the award in international relations.

The grounds for refusing enforcement of foreign awards contained in Section 48 are exhaustive, which is evident from the language of the Section, which provides that enforcement may be refused "only if" the Applicant furnishes proof of any of the conditions contained in that provision.

The enforcement court is not to correct the errors in the award Under Section 48, or undertake a review on the merits of the award, but is conferred with the limited power to "refuse" enforcement, if the grounds are made out.

If the Court is satisfied that the application Under Section 48 is without merit, and the foreign award is found to be enforceable, then Under Section 49, the award shall be deemed to be a decree of "that Court". The limited purpose of the legal fiction is for the purpose of the enforcement of the foreign award. The concerned High Court would then enforce the award by taking recourse to the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The Malaysian Courts being the seat courts were justified in applying the Malaysian Act to the public policy challenge raised by the Government of India. The enforcement court would, however, examine the challenge to the award in accordance with the grounds available Under Section 48 of the Act, without being constrained by the findings of the Malaysian Courts. Merely because the Malaysian Courts have upheld the award, it would not be an impediment for the Indian courts to examine whether the award was opposed to the public policy of India under Section 48 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996. If the award is found to be violative of the public policy of India, it would not be enforced by the Indian courts. The enforcement court would however not second-guess or review the correctness of the judgment of the Seat Courts, while deciding the challenge to the award.

The observation made in paragraph 76.4 of the Reliance judgment does not have any precedential value, since it is an observation made in the facts of that case, which arose out of a challenge to a final partial award on the issue of arbitrability of certain disputes.

(xix) The Appellants have contended that the award may not be enforced, since it is contrary to the basic notions of justice. We are unable to accept this submission for the following reasons: (a) firstly, the Appellants have not made out a case of violation of procedural due process in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings. The requirement of procedural fairness constitutes a fundamental basis for the integrity of the arbitral process. Fair and equal treatment of the parties is a non-derogable and mandatory provision, on which the entire edifice of the alternate dispute resolution mechanism is based. In the present case, there is no such violation alleged. (b) secondly, the Appellants have not made out as to how the award is in conflict with the basic notions of justice, or in violation of the substantive public policy of India.

The enforcement of the foreign award does not contravene the public policy of India, or that it is contrary to the basic notions of justice.

The Civil Appeal is accordingly dismissed, with no order as to costs.

The present Civil Appeal has been filed by the Government of India to challenge the Judgment and Order dated 19 February 2020 passed by the Delhi High Court, wherein the application Under Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 being I.A. No. 3558 of 2015 filed by the Government of India has been dismissed; the Application filed Under Section 47 read with 49 being O.M.P. (EFA) (Comm) 15 of 2016 for the enforcement of the foreign award by the Respondents, and the I.A. No. 20149 of 2014 for condonation of delay in filing the execution petition by the Respondents were allowed.
I. Background Facts
In 1993, the Government of India was desirous of exploring and developing the petroleum resources in the Ravva Gas and Oil Fields (lying 10 to 15 kms offshore in the Bay of Bengal), for which a global competitive tender was floated to invite bids. Pursuant thereto, Videocon International Ltd. and Command Petroleum Holdings NV, the predecessors of the Respondents submitted their bid to develop the Ravva Field along with other bidders. The contract for this petroleum development was to be given on a production sharing basis through a Production Sharing Contract.
On 28.10.1994, the Production Sharing Contract (the "PSC") was executed between the Government of India and the following parties to commercially explore and develop the Ravva Oil and Gas Field:
(a) Command Petroleum (India) Pvt. Ltd., an Australian Company established under the laws of the State of New South Wales, which has since been renamed as Cairn Energy India Pty. Ltd;
(b) Ravva Oil (Singapore) Pty. Ltd., a company established under the laws of Singapore;
(c) Videocon Industries Limited, a company established under the laws of India; and
(d) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC).
The PSC was for a period of 25 years, and the development and exploration of the Ravva Field was to be conducted in terms of the 'Ravva Development Plan'. As per Articles 11.1 and 11.2 of the PSC, Addendums 1 and 2 to the Ravva Development Plan were annexed to the PSC as Appendix F. The Respondents were required to carry out Petroleum Operations in the Ravva Field as per the said Plan. The Ravva Development Plan inter alia contemplated the drilling of 19 oil and 2 gas wells in the Ravva Field.
II. Relevant Terms of the Production Sharing Contract
The dispute between the Parties emanates from Article 15 of the PSC which inter alia provides for the recoverability of Base Development Costs ("BDC") incurred by the Respondents-Claimants for the development of the Ravva Field. The relevant clauses of the PSC are extracted hereinbelow:
(i) Article 11.2 of the PSC reads as:
11.2 Ravva Development Plan
Appendix F to this contract shall constitute the approved development plan for the Existing Discoveries (hereinafter to as "the Ravva Development Plan"). The Ravva Development Plan shall be deemed to have been approved by the Managing Committee.
(ii) The Proposed Development Plan for the Ravva Field (including Addendums 1 and 2), which was accepted by the Parties as the approved Ravva Development Plan, states as follows:
Ravva Field Development Drilling
Estimated Average Well Cost (in US dollars)
TOTAL COST OF AVERAGE WELL $ 2,430,000
Attachment 10
Ravva Field Development Capital Costs
Note: This would be the project, as further defined in the Development Plan, which would be the subject of the cost variation condition. The cost stated includes Import Duty but does not include expenditures related to exploration and appraisal or field abandonment. The difference between the US $218 million total and the estimated US $ 236 million total project capital cost quoted in Section 1 of the accompanying letter is the US $ 18 million abandonment cost.
(emphasis supplied)
(iii) Article 15.5 of the PSC provides for the procedure of recovery of Development Costs incurred by the Respondents in the exploration, discovery and production of oil and gas from the Ravva Oil and Gas Field. Article 15.5 is extracted hereinbelow:
Article 15

....
(i) Having regard, inter alia, to the matters referred to in Article 15.5(d), the Parties agree as follows:
(i) Costs relating to Site Restoration and exploration and appraisal drilling shall not be subject to the limit on Contractor's Development Costs as provided in Article 15.5(b);
(ii) the costs of developing the reserves and/or potential reserves and/or Satellite Fields referred to in Article 15.5(d) (i) shall not be subject to the limit on Contractor's Development Costs as provided in Article 15.5(b) notwithstanding that the development of such reserves and/or potential reserves and/or Satellite Fields may include shared flow lines, injection lines, gas-lift lines and other facilities with those constructed as part of the Ravva Development Plan;
(iii) In the event that the Contractor's Base Development Costs are exceeded by more than five per cent (5%) as a result of:
(aa) delays in carrying out the Development Operations referred to in Article 15.5(d) (iii) due to delay in obtaining necessary approval;
(bb) material changes to the Ravva Development Plan necessitated by Contractor's review of data provided to the Companies by the Government and/or ONGC after the Effective Date pursuant to Article 8.1) (iv), where the Companies are able to establish that had such data been available prior to the Effective Date in the Companies, acting reasonably, would have included such changes in the Ravva Development Plan;

Then the Management Committee shall, at the request of the operator, in a meeting convened Under Article 6, 7, promptly consider what, if any, increase should be made to the Contractor's base Development Costs to fairly reflect the circumstances in the question PROVIDED THAT in the case of delays referred to in Article 15.5 (e) (ii) (aa) the Management Committee shall not be obliged to consider any increase where such delay has been caused by the Contractor's failure to act in a diligent manner.
(e) In the event that:
(i) There is any dispute between the parties, whether or to what extent, a circumstance referred to in Article 15.5(e) (iii) has arisen, or resulted in the Contractor's Base Development Costs being exceeded by more than five percent (5%); or
(ii) The Management Committee is unable to agree whether an increase should be made to the Contractor's Base Development Costs, or is unable to agree on the amount of any such increase; then at any time after thirty (30) days from the date of the Management Committee meeting referred to in Article 15.5(e)(iii), any Party shall be at liberty to refer the matter to a sole expert for decision in accordance with the provisions of Article 34.2.

III. Genesis of the Dispute
(i) The PSC contained a Development Plan for the "Existing Discoveries" known as the Ravva Development Plan. The scheme of the PSC was that the Claimants would incur the costs of the petroleum operations, and were entitled to recover their costs from the petroleum produced. The Government and the Claimants would receive their respective share in the ratio fixed under the PSC.
(ii) Article 15 of the PSC provided for recovery of costs for oil and gas; Article 15.1 is a general provision with respect to contract costs; Article 15.2 to 15.4 pertain to exploration costs. The disputes have arisen on the interpretation of Article 15.5 which pertains to Development Costs. Article 15.5(c) defines the Contractor's Base Development Costs, and enumerates a list of facilities and other matters required to be constructed by the Claimants. The Contractor's Base Development Costs were the costs incurred after the effective date, relating to the construction and/or establishment of such facilities as are necessary to produce, process and transport petroleum within the "Existing Discoveries" in order to enable crude oil production of 35,000 Barrels of Oil Per Day ("BOPD") in accordance with the Ravva Development Plan. The facilities included the construction of offshore tanker loading facilities for tankers upto 120,000 DWT; wellhead platforms capable of supporting upto a total of 24 Development Wells; process facilities; storage facilities with a nominal capacity of 500,000 Barrels; the drilling of 19 Development Wells and 2 Gas Production Wells, etc. Article 15.5(b) and (c) recorded the Agreement between the parties that the Contractor's Base Development Costs shall be the "sum of US $ 188.98 million plus five percent".
It was envisaged that the production profile of 35,000 BOPD would be reached after about two years, and the said production figure would be maintained as a plateau production for 6 years thereafter. A total field production life of 14 years was estimated.
(iii) The Contractor's Base Development Costs were agreed on certain assumptions and/or factors set out in Article 15.5(d), including the range of physical reservoir characteristics not being materially different from the ranges on which the Ravva Development Plan was based.
(iv) There are specific exclusions contained in Article 15.5(e)(i) and (ii), and Sub-article (e)(iii) which set out the circumstances in which the agreed amount of the Contractor's Base Development Costs may be increased by the Management Committee; or in default by an expert, as provided in the dispute resolution clause.
(v) During the working of the PSC, the production rate of 35,000 BOPD was achieved in 1997-1998. By 1998-1999, when the complete extent of the reserves in the Ravva Field was known, the Claimants requested the Government of India to permit an increased production of 50,000 BOPD. This increase was approved by the Management Committee on 25.03.1998, and by the Government on 01.04.1999. By 1999-2000, the increased rate of production at 50,000 BOPD was achieved. This rate of production was maintained till 2008-2009, after which it decreased to 40,000 BOPD. The oil fields were found to be enormously profitable for both parties.
(vi) The Claimants submitted that by 1999-2000, they had incurred Development Costs to the tune of about US $ 220 million to achieve the production rate of 35,000 BOPD. The Claimants sought that the 'cap' in Article 15.5 should be increased accordingly. After 1999-2000 and until 2007-2008, the Claimants incurred Development Costs totalling a further US $ 278 million, which they contended that they were entitled to recover as Cost Petroleum, since the 'cap' would no longer apply post 1999-2000.
The Claimants claimed that they were entitled to more than US $ 264.35 million with respect to Development Costs incurred in 1994-1995 until 2008-2009.
(vii) On the other hand, the Government contended that all the Development Costs claimed by the Claimants were incurred in connection with the Ravva Plan, and were subject to the 'cap' on such costs as provided by Articles 15.5(b) and (c), notwithstanding the increased quantity of production. The exceptions, were however not subject to the 'cap', and were properly recovered from Cost Petroleum Under Article 15.5(a) which totalled to US $ 65.95 million.
(viii) The Government contended that the work contemplated by the Ravva Plan, as per Article 15.5(c) was not completed till 1999-2000, when only 14 wells had been drilled; the remaining 7 wells stipulated in Article 15.5(c)(xi) were drilled by 2007-2008. Consequently, the 'cap' on the Contractor's Base Development Costs would apply to the whole of the costs incurred till 2007-2008, and not the costs incurred till 1999-2000. The Claimants were not entitled to claim more than the Cost Petroleum agreed at US $ 198.43 million plus US $ 65.95 million (towards exceptions).
(ix) The Government raised counter claims equivalent to the amounts which the Claimants had claimed as Cost Petroleum, in excess of the agreed amount of US $ 198.43 million plus US $ 65.95 million.
(x) On 18.08.2008, the disputes were referred to arbitration Under Article 34 of the PSC. The Claimants nominated Mr. Andrew Berkeley as its nominee-arbitrator; the Government of India appointed Hon'ble Dr. Justice Adarsh Sein Anand (former Chief Justice of India) as its nominee-arbitrator. The nominee arbitrators appointed Rt. Hon'ble Sir Anthony Evans as the presiding arbitrator.
(xi) The tribunal passed the Award on 18.01.2011 inter alia holding that:
a) The Claimants constructed facilities which were necessary to produce, process, store and transport Petroleum within the Existing Discoveries to enable Crude Oil production of 35,000 BOPD. The Base Development Costs Under Article 15.5(c) was to be interpreted with reference to the object of achieving a production profile of 35,000 BOPD, and the facilities contemplated to achieve that profile. The Claimants achieved the target of 35,000 BOPD by 1999-2000 by drilling of 14 wells, and incurred Development Costs of US $ 220,737,381.
Article 15.5(b) and (c) imposed a cap on the Development Costs to the agreed figure of US $ 188.98 million plus 5%. The Claimants were not entitled to recover Development Costs in excess of US $ 198.43 million in view of the cap provided Under Article 15.5(c) of the PSC for the period 1994-95 to 1999-2000.
b) The Claimants had wrongly recovered US $ 22,307,381 in excess of the capped figure of US $ 198.43 million as Base Development Costs during the period 1994-95 to 1999-2000. The Government of India was entitled to be credited with the said amount in the final settlement of cost recovery accounts.
c) The PSC contained certain exceptions where the Claimants might incur Development Costs in excess of those anticipated under the PSC and Ravva Development Plan. These exceptions were covered Under Article 15.5(d) and (e) for increase of the BDC cap by the Management Committee.
d) During exploration in 1998-1999, when the complete extent of the reserves in the Ravva Field came to be known, the Management Committee approved an increase in the production profile from 35,000 to 50,000 BOPD. The Respondents proceeded to develop the Ravva Field to achieve the production rate of 50,000 BOPD, and drilled 7 additional wells.
e) The tribunal accepted the evidence of the Expert Witness produced by the Claimants, which found that the enlarged reservoir known as Block A/D in the Ravva Field, showed a range of physical characteristics which were "materially different" from those on which the Ravva Development Plan was based. The range of relevant characteristics which were different from what was anticipated included the fault line on the north-west boundary, which was found not to be sealed, but to be porous; the permeability of the rocks was found to be greater leading to increased production pressures; the oil/water contact levels were found to be different. Article 15.5(e)(iii)(dd) provided that a request for an increase in the BDC cap could be made, since materially different characteristics were encountered in the drilling of the additional wells. In such circumstances, Claimants would be entitled to recover the increased amounts, notwithstanding the limit imposed by Article 15.5(b) and (c).
The tribunal held that the Respondents were entitled to recover US $ 278,871,668 from the Cost Petroleum towards Development Costs incurred by the Respondents for the period 2000-01 to 2008-09.
f) The Award declared as under:
We therefore declare an award, as follows:
A. On the true construction of Article 15.5 of the Production Sharing Contract 20th October 1994 (the PSC), all Development Costs incurred by the Claimants after the date of the PSC in connection with development operations under the Ravva Development Plan are subject (as regards cost recovery from Cost Petroleum) to the cap imposed by Article 15.5 (b) of the PSC, namely, the amount defined as Base Development Cost by Article 15.5(c) plus 5%;
B. The figure stated in Article 15.5(c) of the PSC, namely, US $ 188.98 million, was agreed as the limit for Base Development Cost to be cost-recovered by the Claimants in connection with the Ravva Development Plan as it was agreed in August/October 1993;
C. The Claimants incurred Development Costs totalling $ 220,737,381 in connection therewith up to and including the contract year (31 March annually) 1999/2000;
D. The Claimants were not entitled to cost-recover such costs in excess of the agreed amount plus five percent (5%) namely, $ 198.43 million;
E. That the Claimants incurred Development Costs in connection therewith from contract years 2000/2001 until 2008/2009 in the sum of $ 278,871,668;
F. That in response to the Claimant's request, the amount of Base Development Cost in respect of such period shall be increased by $ 278,871,668 pursuant to Article 15.5(e)(iii)(dd) of the PSC;

accepted by the Respondent
$ 65, 952, 604
increase under (f) above
$ 212, 919, 064
Total
$ 278, 871, 668
H. That the Claimants are and shall be entitled to cost-recover further Base Development Cost incurred by them in connection with the Ravva Development Plan after the contract years 2008/2009, if and to the extent that
a. Such costs are incurred in further development of the reserves defined by this Award as being materially different from the physical characteristics of the reservoir on which the original (1993) Ravva Development Plan was based; and/or
b. The amount of the cap Under Article 15.5(b) of the PSC may be increased hereafter pursuant to Article 15.5(e)(iii) of the PSC; and/or
c. As the parties may agree;
But not otherwise;
I. That the Respondent is entitled to be credited with the sum of $ 22,307,381 in the final settlement of cost recovery accounts in relation to Development Cost incurred during contract years 1994/5 to 1999/2000 in excess of $ 198.43 million.
(xii) The Respondents-Claimants submit that vide their letter dated 29.04.2011 addressed to the Government of India, the revised costs recovery account statements as per the Award were enclosed, and credit of the excess Development Costs of US $22,307,381 was given to the Government of India.
IV. Challenge to the Award before the Seat Courts at Kuala Lumpur
(i) On 15.04.2011, the Government of India challenged the Award Under Section 37 of the Malaysian Arbitration Act, 2005 before the Malaysian High Court, on three principal grounds:
a) the Award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration;
b) the Award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; and
c) the Award is in conflict with public policy.
(ii) The High Court vide Order dated 30.08.2012 rejected the challenge to the Award holding that the requirements of Sections 37(1)(a)(iv) and (v) and Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the Malaysian Act have not been met, to sustain the challenge to the award. The Award did not involve any "new difference," which would have been relevant for determination by the arbitral tribunal. The High Court found no reason which would merit intervention with the Award.
(iii) Aggrieved by the Order dated 30.08.2012, the Government of India preferred an Appeal before the Malaysian Court of Appeal, which was dismissed vide Order dated 27.06.2014. The Malaysian Court of Appeal held that the tribunal had given effect to the agreement between the parties under the terms of the PSC. There was no determination by the tribunal which was outside the submissions of the parties.
(iv) On 10.07.2014, a show cause notice was issued by the Government to the Respondents-Claimants, raising a demand of US $ 77 million towards the Government's share of Profit Petroleum under the PSC. The Respondents were directed to show cause as to why the said amount ought not to be directly recovered from the amounts payable by the Oil Marketing Companies.
(v) On 21.07.2014, the Government filed an Application for Leave to Appeal before the Malaysian Federal Court, which was rejected vide Order dated 17.05.2016.
(vi) During the pendency of the Application for Leave to Appeal before the Malaysian Federal Court, on 14.10.2014, the Respondents-Claimants filed a Petition for enforcement Under Sections 47 read with 49 of the 1996 Act before the Delhi High Court, along with an application for condonation of delay.
(vii) The Government filed an Application Under Section 48 resisting the enforcement of the Award before the Delhi High Court inter alia on the ground that the enforcement petition was filed beyond the period of limitation; the enforcement of the Award was contrary to the public policy of India, and contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.
(viii) The Delhi High Court rejected the Petition Under Section 48 vide the impugned judgment dated 19.02.2020, allowed the application for condonation of delay filed by the Respondents/Claimants, and directed the enforcement of the Award.
(ix) Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the Government has filed the present Civil Appeal before this Court. This Court issued notice vide Order dated 17.06.2020, and directed the parties to maintain status quo till further orders.
(x) Subsequently, the Respondents filed I.A. No. 61469 of 2020 for Modification of the Order of status quo dated 17.06.2020, and for interim directions. The I.A. was taken up for hearing on 22.07.2020, when the Order of status quo was partially modified, and a direction was issued that the sales revenues be paid directly by the Oil Marketing Companies to the Respondents as per the Orders dated 28.05.2020 and 04.06.2020 passed by the Delhi High Court. The Order of status quo would, however, continue to operate with respect to the bank guarantees/deposits of US $ 93 million, during the pendency of the present proceedings.
V. Submissions on behalf of the Appellants
Shri. K.K. Venugopal, Learned Attorney General for India instructed by Mr. K.R. Sasiprabhu, Advocate represented the Government of India. It was submitted that the enforcement of the Award was liable to be refused on the following principal grounds:
(a) Maintainability of the Petition
(i) The Appellants raised an objection to the maintainability of the application on the ground that the petition for enforcement/execution of the foreign award Under Section 47 was barred by limitation.
Since there is no specific provision in the Limitation Act for enforcement of foreign awards, it would necessarily fall under the residuary provision - Article 137.
(ii) Article 137 applies to the enforcement of foreign awards, which provides a period of 3 years from "when the right to apply accrues". It was submitted that the right to apply would accrue from the date of making the award.
In the present case, the Award was passed on 18.01.2011, and the petition for enforcement/execution was filed by the Respondents on 14.10.2014. The petition was barred by 268 days beyond the period of limitation.
(iii) The execution petition for the purposes of the Limitation Act, has to be treated as an application under the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure. The execution of a foreign award Under Section 49 of the 1996 Act, is carried out Under Order XXI Code of Civil Procedure, as held in BCCI v. Kochi Cricket (P) Ltd. MANU/SC/0256/2018 : (2018) 6 SCC 287.
(iv) Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 excludes an application filed Under Order XXI, Code of Civil Procedure.
Section 5 reads as under:
5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases. - Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), may be admitted after the prescribed period, if the Appellant or the Applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period.
(emphasis supplied)
Consequently, the delay in filing the application for enforcement/execution could not be condoned.
(v) Even if it is presumed that the Respondents could invoke the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, the Respondents failed to show sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing the enforcement petition. The ground of pendency of the challenge to the award before the courts in Malaysia, could not be a sufficient ground for condonation of delay.
(vi) It was submitted that the High Court erroneously held that an application for enforcement of an arbitral award would be governed by the limitation period of 12 years Under Article 136 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963.
Article 136 deals with an application for execution of any decree or order of a civil court. This finding is contrary to the express holding in Bank of Baroda v. Kotak Mahindra Bank, wherein it has been held that the period of limitation of 12 years prescribed by Article 136 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, applies only to a decree or order passed by an Indian court. A foreign award could not be treated to be a decree of a civil court.
(vii) It was submitted that the reasoning of the Delhi High Court is contrary to the provisions of the 1996 Act, since it has ignored the express words of Section 49, which provides that the court would require to be "satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter". It was submitted that this is further supported by the language of Section 46 of the Act which pre-supposes an inquiry before the award is said to achieve the status of the decree of a court. The purposive interpretation adopted by the Ld. single judge, could not be used to negate the express terms of the statute.
(viii) For the purpose of making a foreign award enforceable, the procedure available under Part II of the Act is required to be followed. A petition for enforcement and execution of such foreign award by way of a composite petition is required to be filed Under Section 47. A foreign award does not become a decree until and unless it passes the muster of Sections 47 to 49, only after which it acquires the status of a decree. It was only after the Court adjudicates on the enforceability of the foreign award Under Sections 47 to 48, would the foreign award be deemed to be a decree of that Court. Post such adjudication, the foreign award is declared as a deemed decree Under Section 49 of the Act.
The foreign award has no legal sanctity, till an affirmative decision is obtained Under Section 48 of the 1996 Act. The foreign award gets the imprimatur of the Court, before it can be enforced as a deemed decree Under Section 49 of the 1996 Act.
(ix) Section 49 provides that where the Court is satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable, it shall be deemed to be a decree of the Court. The limited purpose of the deeming fiction was to apply the machinery provided Under Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure to enable Indian Courts to execute foreign awards. The foreign award does not transform into a decree of a civil court in India. The foreign award does not lose its character as an arbitral award. It is only presumed to be a decree of the Court, for the purposes of execution.
(b) Challenge on grounds of Public Policy of India
The Government inter alia contended that the foreign Award is in conflict with the Public Policy of India as expounded in the Renusagar MANU/SC/0195/1994 : 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644 judgment. This Court in Renusagar held that public policy of India, in the context of foreign awards would be: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interests of India; or (c) justice or morality.
(i) The PSC related to the exploration and development of petroleum in its natural state in the Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf of India, which is vested in the Union of India. The Government was desirous that the petroleum resources be exploited in the overall interests of India in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices.
The PSC in recital (1) expressly states that petroleum being a natural resource is vested in the Government of India Under Article 297 of the Constitution of India. Since the PSC related to the exploration of a natural resource, there was an inherent character of national and public interest in the implementation of the PSC, and the natural gas was held in the sovereign trust of the people of India. The sovereignty over the petroleum produced would continue to remain with the nation, since the natural gas is a resource which falls squarely within the purview of Article 297 of the Constitution of India.
(ii) The learned A.G. submitted on behalf of the Government of India that the Award was in conflict with the public policy of India. The tribunal had ignored various clauses of Article 15.5(c) read with the Ravva Development Plan, and particularly Attachment 10 thereto, which contained the basis of computation of the "sum" of US $ 188.98 million payable to the Respondents as Base Development Costs.
Article 15.5(c) of the PSC read with the Ravva Development Plan formed the basis of the dispute between the Parties. Article 15.5(c) provided that the Base Development Cost shall mean the costs incurred after the Effective Date relating to the construction and/or establishment of such facilities as were necessary to produce Petroleum from within the Existing Discoveries in order to enable crude oil production of 35,000 BOPD in accordance with the Ravva Development Plan. Such costs "shall include, but not be limited to" costs incurred in relation to the list of facilities mentioned therein.
Sub-clause (xi) Under Article 15.5(c) of the PSC specifically referred to the "drilling of nineteen (19) Oil Wells and two (2) Gas Production Wells". Under Article 15.5(c), the parties had expressly agreed that the Contractor's Base Development Costs shall be the "sum" of US $ 188.98 million, as indicated in the Ravva Development Plan, which was an integral part of the PSC. The sum of US $ 188.98 million took into consideration the drilling of 21 wells as also the construction of facilities mentioned in Article 15.5(c) of the PSC.
The tribunal proceeded on the false assumption that every aspect of Article 15.5 (c), must be subjugated to the achievement of 35,000 BOPD.
The failure of the tribunal to look into all the relevant documents, particularly Attachment 10 to the Ravva Development Plan, which formed an integral part of the PSC, and contained the computation of the amount payable as Base Development Costs, would shock the conscience of the Court, and the award would be in conflict with the basic notions of justice.
(iii) The Ld. A.G. contended that the said Plan contained the computation of the sum of US $ 188.98 million to be paid towards Base Development Cost Under Article 15.5(c) of the PSC. The Ravva Plan provided the approximate cost of drilling one well in the Ravva Field as being US $ 2.43 million.
Attachment 10 to Addendum 2 of the Ravva Development Plan sets out the Development of R10 and R17 blocks - Oil and Associated Gas Reserves. It provides for the drilling and completion of 19 wells, SPM and Tanker Loading Lines, Four platforms, production/injection pipelines to/from shore in-field flow lines, Onshore oil process facilities, Onshore oil storage, Gas treatment and compression, Water injection, Gas lift pipeline and Compression, Project Management, etc., for which an amount of US $ 201.1 million was earmarked.
The total amount payable for the Ravva Development Cost (i.e. 210.1 + 16.9) was US $ 218 million. After deducting US $ 18 million towards abandonment costs and US $ 11.32 million towards import duty, the amount payable would work out to US $ 188.98 million, which is the amount mentioned in Article 15.5(c) of the PSC.
(iv) The tribunal on the basis of one isolated criteria mentioned in Article 15.5 (c) of achieving 35,000 BOPD passed the Award in favour of the Claimants. In fact, the Claimants failed to fulfil the other requirements stated in Article 15.5(c) inter alia with respect to development facilities, which included the drilling of 19 oil wells and 2 gas reserves. This was specifically mentioned in the Ravva Development Plan, which was an integral part of the PSC as stated in Article 11.2 of the PSC. By deciding the claim on the basis of one isolated criteria, it had given a go-by to all the other conditions, which would amount to re-writing the mandatory terms of the contract between the parties, and foisting the Government with obligations, which were never agreed to. The net result of the arbitral award was that the Government of India suffered a huge loss to the tune of approximately Rs. 1,600 crores, which would be contrary to the interests of India.
The tribunal's interpretation of Article 15.5(c) had the effect of substituting the plain language of Sub-clause (xi) of the said Article, with a new stipulation that the cost of construction of the wells in the Ravva Field would be borne by the Government, once the production capacity of 35,000 BOPD was achieved. This interpretation rendered the stipulation of drilling 19 oil wells and 2 gas wells contained in Article 15.5(c)(xi) as nugatory. The tribunal omitted any reference to Attachment 10 of the Ravva Development Plan, which was crucial to the determination of the dispute, and formed an integral part of the PSC, since it contained the basis of the computation of the amount payable towards Base Development Cost. Such an Award would shock the conscience of the Court, and would be in conflict with the public policy of India, and contrary to the interests of India.
The daily rate of production specified in Article 15.5(c) i.e. 35,000 BOPD, was the 'plateau' rate of production which had to be achieved and maintained for a period of 6 years of the contract period. It was not a one-time target to be achieved by the Respondents. The plateau rate of production of 35,000 BOPD could not have been related to the cap of US $ 188.98 million, which related only to the costs incurred for setting up specified facilities Under Article 15.5(c), including the 21 wells.
The tribunal failed to note that the cap of US $ 188.98 million was relatable to the facilities mentioned in Article 15.5(c) of the PSC, which expressly included the drilling and completion of 19 oil wells and two gas wells. The tribunal erred in holding that the cap of US $188.98 million related only to the achievement of a production target of 35,000 BOPD, and adjusted the capped figure of US $ 188 million upon the drilling of 14 wells, when the production capacity of 35,000 BOPD was achieved. The tribunal held that the costs with respect to the 7 wells drilled thereafter, amounting to US $ 278 million, would have to be borne by the Government to the Respondents.
(v) It was further submitted that the Counter Claim raised by the Government was summarily disposed of in paragraph 100 of the Award, and the tribunal gave a finding which was contrary to the express provisions of the contract.
(vi) It was submitted that Clauses 33.1 and 33.2 of the PSC provided that the PSC was governed and interpreted in accordance with Indian law. The Malaysian Courts at the seat of arbitration had erroneously applied the Malaysian Arbitration Act (Act 646), 2005 while deciding the challenge to the Award. The Award was to be tested on the basis of Indian law, as mandated by Article 33 of the PSC. The PSC was to be interpreted as per Indian law.
(vii) Reliance was placed on paragraph 76.4 of the judgment in Reliance Industries v. Union of India, MANU/SC/0518/2014 : (2014) 7 SCC 603 wherein this Court in the penultimate paragraph of that judgment had observed that since the substantive law governing the contract is Indian law, even the Courts in England (seat of arbitration), would be required to decide the issue of arbitrability by applying the Indian law of public policy.
In this case, the Malaysian Courts had erroneously applied the Arbitration Act of Malaysia to uphold the validity of the award.
VI. Submissions on behalf of the Respondents
The Respondents were represented by Mr. C.A. Sundaram and Mr. Akhil Sibal, Senior Advocates.
(a) On Limitation
(i) It was contended that Under Section 49 of the 1996 Act, the foreign award becomes a decree of an Indian court after the objections to the award are adjudicated by the enforcement court.
(ii) Article 136 of the Limitation Act prescribes a period of 12 years from the date of the decree of the civil court, which would be the appropriate provision for execution of a foreign award. In the present case, the foreign award was passed on 18.01.2011, and the Respondents had a period of 12 years to seek enforcement of the award i.e. till 17.01.2023. The execution petition was, therefore, filed within the period of limitation.
(iii) In the alternative, it was contended that if Article 137 of the Limitation Act is held to be applicable for the enforcement of foreign awards, the limitation period would commence from "when the right to apply accrues", which does not necessarily mean the date of the award. Had this been the intention of the legislature, it would have been expressly provided so. The right to apply may accrue even on a later date, as it has in the present case.
(iv) The Award was passed on 18.01.2011 granting a declaration in favour of the Respondents-Claimants. The counter claim of the Government of India was partly allowed, directing the Respondents to revise the cost recovery statements. Consequently, an amount of US $ 22 million became payable by the Respondents-Claimants to the Government of India.
On 10.07.2014, the Government of India issued a notice to the Claimants to show cause as to why US $ 77 million ought not to be directly recovered from the amounts payable by the Oil Marketing Companies.
It was thus contended that the right to apply for enforcement of the award accrued on 10.07.2014.
(v) It was further contended that the period of limitation would commence from the date when the award attained finality at the seat of arbitration. In the present case, the award attained finality at the seat court on 10.05.2016, when the Federal Court of Malaysia rejected the application of the Government of India seeking leave to appeal.
(vi) It was submitted that irrespective of whether limitation Under Article 136 or 137 is applicable for enforcement of foreign awards, Section 5 would be applicable in both cases. Section 5 of the Limitation Act is applicable to any appeal, or any application.
The application for enforcement/execution was filed by the Respondent-Claimants Under Sections 47 and 49 of the 1996 Act, which was a composite application, as per the judgments in Fuerst Day Lawson Limited v. Jindal Exports Limited MANU/SC/0329/2001 : 2001 (6) SCC 356 and LMJ International Limited v. Sleepwell Industries Co. Ltd. MANU/SC/0251/2019 : 2019 (5) SCC 302.
(vii) It was further contended that limitation is a mixed question of fact and law. Reliance was placed on Article 113 of the Limitation Act, which provides that any suit for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in Schedule, the period of limitation is 3 years from the date when the right to sue accrues. The Counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Shakti Bhog Food Industries Ltd. v. The Central Bank of India. Article 137 is similar to the residuary provision in Article 113 for filing applications, for which no period of limitation has been provided elsewhere in this division, and provides a period of 3 years from the date when the right to apply accrues.
If the substantive application was filed Under Sections 47 and 49 of the 1996 Act, it would not fall Under Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, and hence an application Under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be maintainable. Furthermore, since there was uncertainty in the law, as the Madras High Court had held limitation for enforcement of a foreign award to be 12 years, while the Bombay High Court treated this as 3 years, there was sufficient ground to condone the delay.
It was submitted that there is a difference between the execution of a foreign decree Under Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the enforcement of a foreign award Under Section 49 of the 1996 Act. Further, even though Section 36 refers to the enforcement of a domestic award in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, Section 49 does not refer to the Code of Civil Procedure.
The application for enforcement of the foreign award was thus a substantive application Under Section 47 of the 1996 Act, and not one Under Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure. The provisions of Section 5 would consequently apply to the application for enforcement, and the High Court was empowered to condone the delay in filing the application.
(b) On Public Policy of India
(i) It was submitted that the dispute between the parties pertains to the interpretation of Article 15.5(c) of the PSC, which provides for recoverability of Base Development Costs incurred by the Respondent-Claimants in the Ravva Field.
Article 15.5(c) stipulated that the Respondents were entitled to recover US $ 198 million ($ 188 million + 5%) as BDC for the facilities which they developed to achieve a production capacity of 35,000 BOPD. At the time when the PSC was entered into, it was envisaged that for achieving the production capacity of 35,000 BOPD, 21 wells would be required. However, the production capacity was achieved by the Respondents with the construction of 14 wells.
(ii) The Respondents claimed recoverability of BDC as follows:
(a) US $ 220 million for achieving a production profile of 35,000 BOPD, spent by 1999/2000; and
(b) US $ 278 million for raising the production profile from 35,000 BOPD to 50,000 BOPD, spent from 2000/2001 to 2008/2009.
(iii) The Respondents contended that the cap of US $ 198.43 million was applicable only to such facilities as were required to achieve the production capacity of 35,000 BOPD, which in this case was achieved by the drilling of 14 wells. The Respondents were not required to develop the 21 wells enlisted in Article 15.5(c) of the PSC within the cap of US $ 198.43 million.
(iv) The tribunal had correctly interpreted Article 15.5(c) of the PSC, holding that the cap of US $ 198 million on the BDC applied to costs incurred for achieving the production profile of 35,000 BOPD. Since the Respondents had achieved the production capacity of 35,000 BOPD by 1999-2000 by drilling of 14 wells, the Respondents were entitled to recover US $ 198.43 million.
(v) With respect to the balance 7 wells, it was found that the Ravva Field featured materially different physical reservoir characteristics than those originally perceived when the PSC was executed. Accordingly, the trigger Under Article 15.5(e)(iii)(dd) came into operation during the period commencing from 1999-2000 to 2007-2008. For the drilling of the remaining 7 wells, the Respondents were entitled to an additional sum of US $ 278 million.
(vi) It was contended that under the Award, the tribunal had made declarations in favour of the parties. The tribunal had upheld the manner in which the Respondents-Claimants had computed and recovered the costs due to them under the PSC. The tribunal had declared a sum of US $ 22 million as payable by the Respondents to the Government of India, which was paid after the Award was passed.
(vii) It was contended that the issue of interpretation of the PSC, and a review of the merits of the Award, could not be raised Under Section 48 of the 1996 Act. The scope of inquiry Under Section 48 is limited, and the Appellants cannot invite the Court to take a "second look" at the Award by seeking a review on merits.
Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. v. Progretto Grano Spa, MANU/SC/0655/2013 : (2014) 2 SCC 433 wherein it was held that:
45. Moreover, Section 48 of the 1996 Act does not give an opportunity to have a 'second look' at the foreign award in the award-enforcement stage. The scope of inquiry Under Section 48 does not permit review of the foreign award on merits. Procedural defects (like taking into consideration inadmissible evidence or ignoring/rejecting the evidence which may be of binding nature) in the course of foreign arbitration do not lead necessarily to excuse an award from enforcement on the ground of public policy.
x x x
47. While considering the enforceability of foreign awards, the court does not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the foreign award nor does it enquire as to whether, while rendering foreign award, some error has been committed. Under Section 48(2)(b) the enforcement of a foreign award can be refused only if such enforcement is found to be contrary to (1) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (2) the interests of India; or (3) justice or morality. The objections raised by the Appellant do not fall in any of these categories and, therefore, the foreign awards cannot be held to be contrary to public policy of India as contemplated Under Section 48(2)(b).
This view is further fortified by Explanation 2 of Section 48(2) of the Act which clarifies that "the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law, shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute".
(viii) Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in Vijay Karia v. Prysmian Cavi E Sistemi Srl, wherein it was held that the enforcement of a foreign award cannot be refused by taking a different interpretation of the contract. The Supreme Court held that:
45. The U.S. cases show that given the "pro-enforcement bias" of the New York Convention, which has been adopted in Section 48 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - the burden of proof on parties seeking enforcement has now been placed on parties objecting to enforcement and not the other way around; in the guise of public policy of the country involved, foreign awards cannot be set aside by second guessing the arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement of the parties; the challenge procedure in the primary jurisdiction gives more leeway to Courts to interfere with an award than the narrow restrictive grounds contained in the New York Convention when a foreign award's enforcement is resisted.
x x x
96. ... As has been held, referring to some of the judgments quoted hereinabove, in particular Shri Lal Mahal (supra), the interpretation of an agreement by an arbitrator being perverse is not a ground that can be made out under any of the grounds contained in Section 48(1)(b). Without therefore getting into whether the tribunal's interpretation is balanced, correct or even plausible, this ground is rejected.
(emphasis supplied)
(ix) The Respondents contended that the parties had voluntarily chosen Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as the seat of arbitration. Having made such a choice, the Government could not invite Indian courts to revisit the merits of its case under the guise of Indian public policy. In this regard, reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in Bharat Aluminium Co. v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc MANU/SC/0722/2012 : (2012) 9 SCC 648 wherein it was held that:
116. The legal position that emerges from a conspectus of all the decisions, seems to be, that the choice of another country as the seat of arbitration inevitably imports an acceptance that the law of that country relating to the conduct and supervision of arbitrations will apply to the proceedings.
x x x
163. In our opinion, the aforesaid judgment does not lead to the conclusion that the parties were left without any remedy. Rather the remedy was pursued in England to its logical conclusion. Merely, because the remedy in such circumstances may be more onerous from the view point of one party is not the same as a party being left without a remedy. Similar would be the position in cases where parties seek interim relief with regard to the protection of the assets. Once the parties have chosen voluntarily that the seat of the arbitration shall be outside India, they are impliedly also understood to have chosen the necessary incidents and consequences of such choice. We, therefore, do not find any substance in the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the Appellants, that if applicability of Part I is limited to arbitrations which take place in India, it would leave many parties remediless.
(emphasis supplied)
(x) The Counsel submitted that the view taken by the Tribunal was a plausible view, since Article 15.5(e)(iii)(dd) is an exception i.e. when there is a change in the range of the physical reservoir, the cap on the Base Development Costs may be increased. The present case fell in this exception. It was argued that Clause 15.5(c) defined the "Base Development Costs" to mean costs incurred after the effective date relating to the construction and/or establishment of such facilities "as are necessary" to produce petroleum in order to enable crude oil production of 35,000 BOPD in accordance with the Ravva Development Plan. It was argued that the target to be achieved by the Claimants was to produce 35,000 BOPD.
The tribunal correctly relied on Article 15.5(e)(iii)(dd) to hold that the Respondents were entitled to request for an increase in the Base Development Costs, when the range of physical reservoir characteristics of the Existing Discoveries were found to be materially different from those on which the Ravva Development Plan was based. The Respondents had achieved the target of 35,000 BOPD by 1999-2000 with the drilling of 14 wells. The further wells which were drilled subsequently would take into account the changed physical characteristics of the existing reserves. The tribunal had correctly interpreted Article 15.5(c)(xi) to hold that it was not an undertaking given by the Respondents to drill 21 wells, even though only 14 were required.
The Award therefore was not in conflict with the public policy of India, and did not attract the grounds for refusal of enforcement envisaged Under Section 48 of the 1996 Act.
VII. Discussion and Analysis
Part A Limitation for filing an enforcement/execution petition of a foreign award Under Section 47 of the 1996 Act
(i) On this issue, divergent views have been taken by some High Courts with respect to the period of limitation for filing a petition for enforcement of a foreign award under the 1996 Act. It has therefore become necessary to settle the law on this issue.
Noy Vallesina Engineering Spa v. Jindal Drugs Limited MANU/MH/0296/2006 : 2006 (3) Arb LR 510
A single judge of the Bombay High Court held that there is no period of limitation provided by any of the Articles in the Schedule to the Limitation Act, for making an application for execution of a foreign award. It was held that the enforcement of a foreign award must take place in two stages. In the first stage, the enforceability of the foreign award would be decided, which would be governed by the residuary provision i.e. Article 137 which provides for 3 years from when the right to apply accrues. After the issue of enforceability of award is determined, the award is deemed to be a decree, and the execution of the award as a deemed decree would be governed by Article 136 which provides a period of 12 years.
Louis Dreyfous Commodities Suisse v. Sakuma Exports Limited MANU/MH/2613/2015 : (2015) 6 Bom CR 258
Another view was taken by another single judge of the Bombay High Court in this case, wherein it was held that the period of limitation for enforcement of a foreign award would be 3 years from the date when the right to apply accrues i.e. Article 137 of the Limitation Act.
Imax Corporation v. E-City Entertainment (I) Pvt. Limited MANU/MH/3184/2019 : (2020) 1 AIR Bom 82
In Imax, a third view was taken by another single judge of the Bombay High Court, which followed the judgment in Fuerst Day Lawson, MANU/SC/0329/2001 : (2001) 6 SCC 356 and held that since the foreign award is already stamped as a decree, the award holder may apply for enforcement after steps are taken for the execution of the award Under Sections 47 and 49 of the 1996 Act. In one proceeding there may be different stages, the first stage being that the court would be required to decide on the enforceability of the award, having regard to the requirement of the said provisions; and thereafter, proceed to take further steps for execution of the award. It was concluded that Article 136 of the Limitation Act would be applicable for the enforcement of a foreign award.
M/s. Compania Naviera 'SODNOC' v. Bharat Refineries Limited MANU/TN/8070/2007 : (2008) 1 Arb LR 344
A single judge of the Madras High Court held that under the 1996 Act since the foreign award is already stamped as a decree, the award holder can straight away apply for enforcement of the foreign award as a decree holder, and would have a period of 12 years for enforcement.
Cairn India Limited v. Union of India
The Delhi High Court in the impugned Judgment in this case held that Article 136 of the Limitation Act would be applicable for the enforcement of a foreign award. The execution of the award takes place in three stages: access, recognition and enforcement. Section 47 deals with the first and second stages i.e. access and recognition. A foreign award which passes the gateway of Section 47 is at that stage enforceable on its own strength as a 'foreign decree', and is not necessarily dependent on whether or not it goes through the process of Section 48. Such a foreign award is treated as being equivalent to a foreign decree, whose enforcement may be refused only Under Section 48. Section 48 pre-supposes that a foreign award is a decree whose execution can be resisted by a party against whom it is sought to be executed, if it is able to discharge the burden that the objections can be sustained under one or more of the clauses of Sub-section (1) and/or Sub-section (2) of Section 48 of the 1996 Act.
The Delhi High Court held that Article 136 of the Limitation Act would be applicable for filing a petition for enforcement of a foreign award. Even if it is assumed that Article 137 of the Limitation Act is applicable, sufficient grounds for condonation of delay had been urged since the Applicants were under the bona fide belief that the period of limitation for enforcement of a foreign award was 12 years from the date of the Award, as held in Compania Naviera (supra) by the Madras High Court.
(ii) Given the conflicting stands taken by various High Courts, we will now discuss this issue.
The issue of limitation for enforcement of foreign awards being procedural in nature, is subject to the lex fori i.e. the law of the forum (State) where the foreign award is sought to be enforced.1 Article III of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Awards, 1958 provides that:
Each Contracting State shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the Rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon, under the conditions laid down in the following Articles. There shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed in the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards.
(emphasis supplied)
(iii) It would be instructive to refer to the Report of the General Assembly of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in its 41st Session dated 16th June - 3rd July, 2008 with respect to the legislative implementation of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York 1958) (UN Doc A/CN.9/656/Add.1), wherein it was noted that the Convention does not prescribe a time limit for making an application for recognition and enforcement of foreign awards. Article III of the Convention states that recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards should be done in accordance with the Rules of procedure of the State where the award was to be enforced. The time limit may be specifically provided in the national legislation for recognition or enforcement of Convention awards, or it may be a general Rule applicable to court proceedings.2
(iv) The limitation period for filing the enforcement/execution petition for enforcement of a foreign award in India, would be governed by Indian law. The Indian Arbitration Act, 1996 does not specify any period of limitation for filing an application for enforcement/execution of a foreign award. Section 43 however provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations, as it applies to proceedings in court.
(v) The Limitation Act, 1963 does not contain any specific provision for enforcement of a foreign award. Articles 136 and 137 fall in the Third Division of the Schedule to the Limitation Act. Article 136 provides that the period of limitation for the execution of any decree or order of a "civil court" is twelve years from the date when the decree or order becomes enforceable.
(vi) Article 137 is the residuary provision in the Limitation Act which provides that the period of limitation for any application where no period of limitation is provided in the Act, would be three years from "when the right to apply accrues".
Articles 136 and 137 read as:
Description of the Application
Period of Limitation
Time from which period begins to run
136. For the execution of any decree (other than a decree granting a mandatory injunction) or order of any civil court.
Twelve Years
When the decree or order becomes enforceable or where the decree or any subsequent order directs any payment of money or the delivery of any property to be made at a certain date or at recurring periods, when default in making the payment or deliver in respect of which execution is sought, takes place: Provided that an application for the enforcement or execution of a decree granting a perpetual injunction shall not be subject to any period of limitation.
137. Any other application for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in this division.
Three years
When the right to apply accrues.
(emphasis supplied)
(vii) Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 creates a statutory fiction for the limited purpose of enforcement of a 'domestic award' as a decree of the court, even though it is otherwise an award in an arbitral proceeding3. By this deeming fiction, a domestic award is deemed to be a decree of the court4, even though it is as such not a decree passed by a civil court. The arbitral tribunal cannot be considered to be a 'court,' and the arbitral proceedings are not civil proceedings. The deeming fiction is restricted to treat the award as a decree of the court for the purposes of execution, even though it is, as a matter of fact, only an award in an arbitral proceeding.
In Param Singh Patheja v. ICDS Ltd. MANU/SC/4798/2006 : (2006) 13 SCC 322, this Court in the context of a domestic award, held that the fiction is not intended to make an award a decree for all purposes, or under all statutes, whether state or central. It is a legal fiction which must be limited to the purpose for which it was created. Paragraphs 39 and 42 of the judgment in Param Singh Patheja read as:
39. Section 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1899 provides for "enforcing" the award as if it were a decree. Thus a final award, without actually being followed by a decree (as was later provided by Section 17 of the Arbitration Act of 1940), could be enforced i.e. executed in the same manner as a decree. For this limited purpose of enforcement, the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure were made available for realizing the money awarded. However, the award remained an award and did not become a decree either as defined in Code of Civil Procedure and much less so far the purposes of an entirely different statute such as the Insolvency Act are concerned.
