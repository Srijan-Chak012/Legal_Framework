Case Note:
Civil - Central vista project - Modification of - Present petitions filed to undertake comprehensive and heightened judicial scrutiny regarding permissibility of Central Vista Project of Government of India - Diverse issues concerning decisions taken by statutory Authorities including regarding change in land use, grant of statutory and other permissions, environmental as well as heritage clearances etc., had been raised - Whether change in land use of six plots in Central Vista project, permissions/approvals granted by Central Vista Committee, and clearance/no-objection for construction of new Parliament House under Environment Protection Act, 1986 was suffer from any infirmity.

Facts:

The present petitions filed to undertake comprehensive and heightened judicial scrutiny regarding the permissibility of the Central Vista Project of the Government of India. Diverse issues concerning the decisions taken by the statutory Authorities including regarding the change in land use, grant of statutory and other permissions, environmental as well as heritage clearances etc., have been raised in these proceedings. The challenge was premised on high principles of democratic values as applicable in India and not limited to mere infringement of statutory provisions of the governing enactments. That was on account of the nature of project-being of high political significance and eminence for democratic republic and for upholding the Rule of Law, which was on a higher pedestal than the governance by Rule by Law.

Held, while disposing off the petitions:

A.M. Khanwilkar, J.

(i) Upon a close scrutiny of the information supplied in Form I and I-A, documents supplied by the project proponent and appraisal made by the EAC, this court was of the view that the grant of EC was in conformity with the mandate of the competent authority and is just and proper. The project proponent had undertaken various expert studies to prepare a comprehensive traffic management plan, solid waste management plan, water management plan and waste disposal plan. There was ample information on record to show that the project proponent has adequately addressed various facets of the project including source of water, disposal of water, generation of concrete, disposal of concrete, power availability, concerns relating to landscape etc. and the Petitioners had outrightly failed to substantiate their apprehensions by placing material on record to the contrary. [364]

(ii) In the present case, the subject project was an independent building and construction project wherein one-time construction activity was to be carried out. It was not a perpetual or continuous activity like a running industry. It was absolutely incomprehensible to accept that a project of this nature would be unsustainable with the needs and aspirations of future generations. Furthermore, the increase in footprint was not shown to be substantial and the inclusion of new members of Parliament after the delimitation exercise was anyway going to lead to an inevitable increase in footprint (floating though) that cannot be countenanced as a concern here. [380]

(iii) The apprehension of the Petitioners regarding percentage contracts is also unfounded, for the same is taken care of by Manual for Procurement of Consultancy & Other Services, 2017 released by Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. Chapter-3 of the Manual provides for Risks and Mitigations relating to percentage contracts. Thus, there was no absolute prohibition on percentage contracts. The only requirement was mitigation which could be done by a fixed target cost. In the present case, by releasing a subsequent corrigendum, the consultancy fee was capped by the project proponent irrespective of the final cost of the project and thus, no apprehension of lack of economic design survives. [397]

(iv) The contention regarding conduct of a design competition before finalizing the design of the proposed structure could, at best, be understood as a suggestion. For, there was no legally binding duty upon the project proponent to conduct a design competition for a project of this nature. [398]

(v) The project did not involve any conversion into private ownership and had no element whatsoever of permitting commercial use of vital public resources. The proposed project was in line with the standards of public trust and the Petitioners had failed to point out any circumstance which would suggest otherwise. [407]

(vi) This court declare and direct as follows:

(1) There was no infirmity in the grant of:

(a) No Objection by the Central Vista Committee (CVC)

(b) Approval by the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) as per the DUAC Act, 1973 and

(c) Prior approval by the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) under the Building Byelaws for Delhi, 2016.

(2) The exercise of power by the Central Government under Section 11A(2) of the DDA Act, 1957 was just and proper and thus the modifications regarding change in land use of plot Nos. 2 to 8 in the Master Plan of Delhi, 2021/Zonal Development Plan for Zone-D and Zone-C vide impugned notification stands confirmed.

(3) The recommendation of Environmental Clearance (EC) by Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and grant thereof by MoEF was just, proper and in accordance with law including the 2006 Notification. This court uphold the same along with appropriate directions therein to ensure that the highlighted mitigating measures were followed by the project proponent in their letter and spirit.

(4) The project proponent may set up smog tower(s) of adequate capacity, as being integral part of the new Parliament building project; and additionally, use smog guns at the construction site throughout the construction phase is in progress on the site.

(5) This court also call upon the Respondent MoEF to consider issuing similar general directions regarding installation of adequate capacity of smog tower(s) as integral part in all future major development projects whilst granting development permissions, particularly in cities with bad track record of air quality-be it relating to Government buildings, townships or other private projects of similar scale and magnitude, including to use smog guns during the construction activity of the Project was in progress.

(6) The stage of prior permission under the Building Bye Laws of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), was the stage of actual development/redevelopment etc. work was to commence and not the incipient stage of planning and formalisation of the Project. Accordingly, the Respondents shall obtain aforementioned prior permission of the designated Authority before actually starting any development/redevelopment work on the stated plots/structures/precincts governed by the heritage laws including on plot, if already not obtained.

(7) The selection/appointment of Consultant, in light of the limited examination warranted in this case, was held to be just and proper. [423]

Sanjiv Khanna, J.

(i) Given the nature and importance the statutory provisions which emphasise on fair participation of the public in the deliberations, and the importance and significance of Central Vista, this court did not think it would be appropriate and correct to ignore failure on the part of the Respondents to ascribe to the principle of intelligible and adequate disclosure to fulfil the requirement of public participation. Right to make objections and suggestions in the true sense, would include right to intelligible and adequate information regarding the proposal. Formative and constructive participation forms the very fulcrum of the legislative scheme prescribed by the Development Act and the Development Rules. Every effort must be made to effectuate and actualise the participatory rights to the maximum extent, rather than read them down as mere irregularity or dilute them as unnecessary or not mandated. [462]

(ii) The Central Government had not placed on record even a single document or minutes to show that the objections and suggestions were considered by the Central Government, albeit they place reliance on the gazette notification which did not specifically talk about considerations of objections and suggestions but states whereas the Central Government have after carefully considering all aspects of the matter, had decided to modify the Master Plan for Delhi 2021/Zonal Development Plan for Zone D and Zone C. [476]

(iii) There was violation of the Section 45 as public notice of hearing fixed was issued by way of public notice. SMS and email were issued at the last moment. Lack of reasonable time, therefore, prevented the persons who had filed objections and given suggestions to present and appear orally state their point of view. [483]

(iv) Reading of the minutes does not show fair and independent application of mind. The committee had decided to accord approval in principle as the process for change of land use had been taken up by the competent authorities and then records accordingly, the final approval for change of land use may be communicated. Member representing Indian Institute of Architects had wanted detailed facts on the matter. His request was ignored. Conspicuously there was no discussion on the aspect of lack of information. Use of the word in principle was indicative, if not reflects tentativeness, as if, it was not an expression of a firm opinion. Opinion and advise of the Committee was certainly of great value and importance. Their advice had been uniformly taken and followed for any redevelopment/changes in the Central Vista. [485]

(v) The Central Vista Precincts, i.e. at the Rajpath, per se did not have any building. This did not mean that the precincts of other heritage buildings, namely, the Parliament, North and South Blocks, National Archives were not to be treated as areas adjoining the listed buildings. A contrary interpretation would virtually negate the meaning of precincts to the building. The idea behind declaring the area as historical precincts is to give protection even if no constructed structure exists. It was an additional protection, when several buildings have already been included in the heritage list. In the present case, as per the Petitioners, it was to clarify and clear any doubt that the green areas/parks in the Central Vista Precinct within the demarcated line/boundaries were entitled to protection as Grade I under the Unified Building Bye Laws. In this regard reference could made to Unified Building Bye-Laws for Delhi, 2016, and which appear to be apposite. [504]

(vi) Thus, setting aside and quashing the final notification of modification/change of the land use in respect of the six plots in the Central Vista with certain directions. [522]

(vii) This court set aside the order of the EAC and environment clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forest and would pass an order of remit to the EAC with a request that they may decide the question on environment clearance within a period of thirty days from the date copy of this order received, without awaiting the decision on the question of change/modification of land use. Speaking and reasoned order would be passed. [523]

Conclusion and Order
INTRODUCTION
1. By these petition(s)/appeal(s)/case(s), we are called upon by the Petitioners to undertake a comprehensive and heightened judicial scrutiny regarding the permissibility of the Central Vista Project1 of the Government of India. Diverse issues concerning the decisions taken by the statutory Authorities including regarding the change in land use, grant of statutory and other permissions, environmental as well as heritage clearances etc., have been raised in these proceedings. The challenge is premised on high principles of democratic values as applicable in India and not limited to mere infringement of statutory provisions of the governing enactments. That is on account of the nature of project-being of high political significance and eminence for our democratic republic; and for upholding the "Rule of Law", which is on a higher pedestal than the governance by "Rule by Law".
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
2. As per the policy documents, the need for the development of the Project is rooted in the creation of a larger working space for efficient functioning of the highest legislative wing of the country and for integrated administrative block for Ministries/Departments presently spread out at different locations including on rental basis.
3. The Parliament House building, a Grade-I heritage structure, was commissioned in 1927 and stands as a 93 years old structure today. The structure has been subjected to various modifications in the post-independence period so as to maintain its functionality as per changing requirements. Post 1971 census wherein the total population of India was recorded as 548,159,6521, the number of seats for the House of People was fixed at 545. Today, the population has spiralled exponentially and is stated to have crossed the 130-crore mark. The next delimitation exercise, proposed to take place in 2026, is bound to result in a substantial increase in the total number of seats in both the Houses. Accordingly, enhanced and commensurate spatial requirements ought to be in place.
4. The present Central Hall has a seating capacity of only 440 persons. That already falls short of the present need to accommodate members of both Houses together during a joint session. Presently, there is no scope to expand the existing Central Hall. Resultantly, the Joint Sessions of both the Houses of Parliament are conducted by way of a makeshift arrangement in the Central Hall causing inconvenience to the members attending official functions thereat, apart from undermining their dignity. Furthermore, the structure falls short of fire, water and electrical safety norms and poses a grave security risk for the legislators and secretariat staff.
5. In order to address the concerns stated above, the Central Government decided to construct a new Parliament building with a futuristic approach and the House of People being 3 times the size of the present chamber. That along with the present Parliament building and Annexe attached therewith, would be referred to as the Parliament Complex. It is further proposed that all the 51 Ministries of the Central Government be housed in 10 buildings within an integrated complex marked with underground transit connectivity and structural identity. Expressing the need for urgent completion of the project, it has been stated that the new Parliament shall symbolize the 75th Independence Day of the country in 2022 as well as the Global G-20 Summit to be hosted by India in the same year. The objectives, as stated in the written submissions of the Respondents, succinctly read thus:
(i) A new Parliament Building with space and technology to meet the present and emerging needs of vibrant Indian democracy.
(ii) Common Central Secretariat with all Ministries in a single location for efficiency and synergy in functioning.
(iii) Central Vista to be redeveloped as a world class public space and venue for national and international events.
6. Similar structural defects, along with acute shortage of office spaces, have been pointed out in the offices of various Ministries presently spread across 47 buildings in the Central Vista region and in particular, Central Secretariat block. It is stated that various buildings housing the Ministries, including North Block and South Block, are ill-equipped to meet even the basic fire and earthquake safety norms and require regular upgradations involving recurring expenses to the tune of Rs. 50 crores annually. As per Non-Availability Certificates (NACs) issued by Directorate of Estate, a shortage of 3.8 lakh sq.m. of office space has been flagged. To add to this state of affairs, the Central Government is spending an amount equivalent to about Rs. 1,000 crores on rental spaces to accommodate the offices of various Ministries annually. The proposal states thus:
Most of the buildings in the Central Vista area are more than 40-50 years old and have either outlived or approaching their structural lives. Further buildings constructed over 100 years ago such as North and South Block are not earthquake safe. There is shortage of working spaces, parking amenities and services. The spread of Central Government Ministries and Departments in different locations leads to inefficiencies and difficulty in coordination.
7. Upon examination of other documents associated with the Project, the objectives for redeveloping/constructing the existing Central Secretariat have been broadly summed up thus:
(i) Even after 73 years of independence, the nation does not have a common secretariat building. Some Ministries are housed in Central Vista complex while some Ministries are housed in other parts of Delhi;
(ii) Various Ministries, due to lack of available space, have hired premises on rent and till date most of the rent paid for and on behalf of the Central Government for using its Ministries in Delhi runs into thousands of crores;
(iii) Except North Block and South Block and one or two other buildings, rest of the buildings are not heritage buildings and are constructed in the near vicinity based upon the need;
(iv) Most of the existing buildings have outlived its structural life and are not earthquake resistant;
(v) As there is no common Central Secretariat and Ministries are spread over different locations, the resultant effect is administrative inefficiency and difficulty in inter-departmental coordination;
(vi) This also leads to travelling, resulting into traffic congestion and pollution;
(vii) Existing secretariat buildings spread all over haphazardly, suffering from poor servicing, inefficient use of land, inadequate facilities and outdated infrastructure;
(viii) There are six plots on Central Vista, which houses temporary barracks or stable building during 2nd World War occupying 90 acres of land, which has remained underutilised;
(ix) To utilise the underutilised spaces in the Central Vista region;
(x) Integrated functioning of all offices of the Central Government;
(xi) Modernisation of Government work spaces for enhanced productivity and efficient management of human resources;
(xi) To promote the concept of green buildings commensurate with scientific standards and sustainable with the needs of future generations; and
(xiii) To connect all the ministerial offices through an underground shuttle transportation system for smooth performance of routine administrative functions.
8. As regards the decision to supplement the existing Parliament building (on plot No. 116 admeasuring 10.75 acres having built-up area 44940 sq. mts.) with utilities constructed on plot No. 118 admeasuring 10.5 acres having built-up area of 5200 sq. mts. which is not a heritage building/site; has been felt necessary because:
(i) The existing Parliament House was constructed during 1921-1927;
(ii) The building was constructed prior to independence to house the Imperial Legislative Council and was never intended to house a bicameral national legislature;
(iii) 2 floors were added to this structure in 1956 as per the demand for more space;
(iv) Periodically ad-hoc additions have taken place in this building as per the requirement of the day, which has added to an additional stress on the heritage structure;
(v) The building is not designed as per the fire norms;
(vi) Water supply lines and sewer lines are installed in a haphazard manner, leading to seepage and destroying the heritage nature of the building;
(vii) These systems like audio-video system, A/c system etc. are later additions and were installed in various stages on an ad-hoc basis;
(viii) By 2026, the number of seats in Lok Sabha would increase from 545. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are packed and would have no capacity for addition of seats when the number of seats would increase;
(ix) To prepare the Houses of Parliament for emerging spatial requirements in light of the impending delimitation exercise.
(x) In the Central Hall of the Parliament, the seating capacity is only for 440 persons. Whenever constitutional joint sessions are held, large number of temporary seats are placed in the aisles, undermining the dignity of this great democratic institutions;
(xi) The cramped seating arrangement both for members of the House and the staff posed a serious security risk in case of either any fire hazard or any external attack requiring quick evacuation. The existing Parliament is not built from the earthquake resistant point of view;
(xii) Concerns about these factors have been raised periodically by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha in past.
(xiii) To ensure a modern and technologically advanced space for single and joint sittings of the Houses of Parliament commensurate with modern safety norms; and
(xiv) To preserve the built heritage by not undertaking aggressive reconstruction activity on graded heritage structures on which only minimum renovation measures are permissible in law.
9. Before we begin the discussion, we deem it fit to observe that the proposal, as far as change in land use is concerned, comprises of seven plots falling in the central vista region-Plots No. 22 (or Plot No. 118-New Parliament Building), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The terms "central vista region or area" and "central vista precincts", as used at various places in the judgment, are not interchangeable. Whereas the central vista region broadly refers to the entire region as per the master plan, central vista precincts refers to the "Central Vista Precincts at Rajpath" as per the list of 141 heritage buildings/precincts. The subject plots, except plot No. 3, fall in the central vista region and not in the central vista precincts.
10. In a constitutional democracy governed by Rule of Law where diversity of views is both heard and respected; and the principle of constitutionalism touches both ends as well as means of accomplishing the wisest of intentions, every action of the Government, howsoever laudable, need not have a free flow in its implementation and unless it stands the test of constitutional parameters. In the same vein, the Petitioners herein (claiming to be public spirited persons) have approached this Court taking exception to various aspects of the project, including but not limited to the manner and procedure adopted for effecting the proposed changes in the central vista precincts. Our examination flows from such objections which have been presented to us in this set of cases.
PROCEEDINGS AND CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES
11. After objections to the proposed change in land use were received by the Delhi Development Authority3 and public hearings were conducted thereagainst, the Petitioners approached the High Court of Delhi4 for challenging the Public Notice dated 21.12.2019 in W.P. (C) No. 1568 of 2020. The learned single Judge of High Court, vide order dated 11.2.2020, directed the Respondents to inform the Court before taking any step in furtherance of the impugned public notice. The relevant extract of the order reads thus:
20. In case, a decision is taken to notify the proposed changes in MPD 2020-21, the DDA will approach the court before notifying such decision.
12. The Respondent Union of India took exception to the aforesaid order by filing L.P.A. No. 119 of 2020 before the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division Bench ordered an ex-parte stay on the above direction of learned single Judge vide order dated 28.2.2020. Another writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 1575 of 2020 was also pending before the High Court.
13. Aggrieved by the order of the Division Bench, the Petitioners approached this Court vide S.L.P. (Civil) Diary No. 8430 of 2020 which resulted in the withdrawal of the entire subject matter before this Court in terms of order dated 6.3.2020, which reads thus:
.........
In our opinion, it is just and proper that writ petition itself is heard by this Court instead of examining the grievance about the manner in which the interim directions have been passed and then vacated by the High Court. Indeed, this order is not a reflection on the proceedings before the High Court, in any manner, but in larger public interest, we deem it appropriate that the entire matter pertaining to challenge pending before the High Court is heard and decided by this Court expeditiously.
We are given to understand that there is one more writ petition pending before the High Court involving the same issue. Accordingly, Writ Petition Nos. 1568 and 1575 of 2020 pending before the High Court of Delhi shall stand withdrawn to this Court and be registered as Transferred Cases, to be heard along with the present Special Leave Petition on 18.03.2020.
Letters Patent Appeal No. 119 of 2020 before the High Court stands disposed of in terms of this order.
Any steps taken by the authorities, in the meantime, will be subject to the outcome of the proceedings.
Liberty is granted to both sides to file additional documents.
The Registry shall forthwith call for the case records of Writ Petition Nos. 1568 and 1575 of 2020 from the High Court.
Thereafter, more petitions were filed and we agreed to hear all petitions analogously. We deem it apposite to reproduce two other orders passed in the leading case dated 19.6.2020 and 29.7.2020 respectively. The same read thus:
19.6.2020

29.7.2020
ORDER
Heard learned Counsel for the parties on the preliminary objection raised by Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the applicant(s)-intervenor(s).
In deference to the observations made by the Court, Mr. Shyam Divan submits that he would commend to the applicant(s) in application I.A. No. 59230/2020 to file substantive writ petition challenging the environmental clearance dated 17.06.2020 by way of writ petition Under Article 32 of the Constitution while maintaining the preliminary objection already raised so that all aspects can be considered by the Court at appropriate stage.
Counsel for the Respondent(s) and the Petitioner(s) have no objection to take recourse to this option while permitting each of them to file response to the proposed writ petition, to be filed by the applicant(s) in I.A. No. 59230/2020. As assured by Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel, the substantive writ petition will be filed within one week from today.

Advance copy of the proposed writ petition be served by the applicant(s) in the office of the Solicitor General through e-mail/on-line, at the time of filing the same in the Registry.
List the matters at the end of Board in the week commencing 17th August, 2020.
Being mindful of the prevailing state of affairs amidst the pandemic, we refrained from insisting upon technicalities during the course of hearing and granted complete freedom to the parties, both in terms of timelines and volume of submissions, to file pleadings, written statements and documents. We may now advert to the challenge raised by the Petitioners in the subject petitions.
Civil Appeal No. ........../2020 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. ..........2020 @ Diary No. 8430/2020)
14. The Appellant (writ Petitioners) has challenged the order of Division Bench on the ground that well-considered order of learned single Judge came to be vacated by the Division Bench without hearing the Appellant. This amounted to violation of the basic principles of natural justice which required the Appellant to be heard before passing an adverse order. It is further stated that the learned single Judge had asked the Respondents to file a reply to the original writ petition, however, no reply was filed and the Division Bench failed to consider this aspect while vacating the stay granted by the learned single Judge.
15. In this appeal arising out of special leave petition, the applicants (third parties) filed I.A. No. 59796/2020 praying for recall/modification of the order of this Court dated 6.3.2020 whereby the following direction was issued:
We make it clear that any other petition/proceedings instituted or to be filed hereafter by any party concerning the subject Project, be heard and proceeded along with the present cases.
The applicants have contended that the aforesaid direction debarred the applicants from approaching the National Green Tribunal5 for the invocation of their statutory remedy of challenging the grant of environmental clearance6. It is submitted that NGT, being an expert body equipped with technical members, ought to exercise jurisdiction concerning environmental issues in the first place. Hence, the order of this Court could not have curtailed the statutory remedies otherwise available to the applicants. At the conclusion of the hearing of these cases, however, the learned Counsel for the applicants had prayed that this application be disposed of as infructuous.
T.C. (C) No. 229/2020
(formerly W.P. (C) No. 1568 of 2020 before the High Court of Delhi)
16. In this petition, originally filed in the High Court Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the Petitioners therein have assailed the public notice dated 21.12.2019 and final notification for change in land use dated 20.3.2020. The relevant prayers read thus:
I. Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction calling for records and quashing Public Notice S.O. 4587 E : MANU/NMIC/0652/2019 dated 21.12.2019, issued by Respondent No. 1 Delhi Development Authority (DDA); and/or
xxx xxx xxx
IV. Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction calling for records and quashing Notification S.O. 1192 (E) dated 20.03.2020 issued by Union of India Represented Through Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.
17. The Land & Development Officer7, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs8, Government of India, being the land-owning agency of the plots, initiated the process of change in land use vide letter No. L&DO/L-IIA/11(1158)/545 dated 4.12.2019 for 8 plots. Plots No. 1 to 7 and 8 are in Planning Zone-D and C respectively of the central vista area. The said proposal was considered in the Technical Committee Meeting of the DDA on 5.12.2019 wherein the proposal was recommended for further processing by the Authority. The recommendation reads thus:
After detailed deliberation, the proposal as contained in Para 4.0 of the agenda with the above modification in land use for Plot No. 1 was recommended by the Technical Committee for further processing Under Section 11A of DD Act, 1957. With the following conditions:
(i) The clearances from the PMO, Heritage Conservation Committee and Central Vista Committee shall be taken by L&DO.
(ii) The heritage buildings shall be dealt as per the relevant heritage provisions.
(emphasis supplied)
18. Thereafter, on 11.12.2019, in the meeting of the Authority at Raj Niwas, Delhi (Lieutenant Governor's Residence), the recommendations of the Technical Committee were placed for consideration. The Authority approved the recommendations with a direction for issuing public notice inviting objections/suggestions from the public qua the proposed modifications in accordance with Section 11A of the Delhi Development Act, 19579. The decision taken on 11.12.2019 reads thus:
The proposal contained in the agenda item was approved. Public notice inviting objections/suggestions Under Section 11A of DD Act, 1957 be issued.
19. Thereafter, on 21.12.2019, the Authority issued Public Notice S.O. 4587 E : MANU/NMIC/0652/2019 with a proposal for the change in land use of Plots No. 1 to 8 situated at different direction/location in Zones C and D and inviting suggestions/objections from the citizens of the country qua the said proposal. After a public hearing on objections, the matter was considered by the Authority in its following meeting chaired by Lt. Governor, Delhi on 10.2.2020. The Board recommended that a fresh proposal be initiated as regards plot No. 1. This recommendation was accepted by the Authority in the meeting. Thus, plot No. 1 stood excluded from the original proposal and is not the subject matter of these petitions. As regards plots No. 2 to 8, the Authority approved the proposal after public consultation and the same was finally submitted to the Central Government for issuing the final notification. On 20.3.2020, the final notification (impugned) was issued by the Central Government notifying the change in land use of plots Nos. 2 to 8.
20. To buttress the challenge, the Petitioner would assert that the changes in land use had been proposed without framing an updated Zonal Development Plan10 for Zone D, as mandated in the Master Plan Delhi, 202111, and therefore, the changes are not backed by updated information and empirical data. It is submitted that the Respondents relied upon an old ZDP of 2001 for carrying on the changes. Further, in the absence of an updated plan, an informed decision could not have been taken by the Respondents with regard to the proposed changes, more particularly relating to standards of population density. It is supplemented by referring to Chapter-16 of the Master Plan which requires a comprehensive land use plan based on current data for undertaking different urban activities, social and physical infrastructure.
21. It is submitted that the proposal issued is ultra vires Section 11A of 1957 Act as the Authority had no power to modify the land use of subject plots. The argument stems from the understanding that the proposed modifications substantially alter the Master Plan and Section 11A(1) prohibits the Authority from undertaking modifications of a nature that effect important alterations in the character of the plan. It is submitted that the nature of changes proposed could not have been carried forth in the name of modifications as they were of a substantial nature and thus, required a fresh Master Plan or amendment to the extant Master Plan.
22. Mr. Shikhil Suri, learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that since the notice dated 21.12.2019 stood vitiated in terms of the abovementioned submissions, the final notification dated 20.3.2020 is bad and illegal as such notification ought to have preceded by a valid public notice. The Petitioner submits that the proposed changes contradict the Master Plan. An attempt has been made to demonstrate contradictions within various chapters of the plan. It is stated that the public notice does not advert to Chapter-17 of the Master Plan which provides for a "Development Code" and lays emphasis on the quality of built environment while considering any land use proposals and development policies. It is stated that Chapter-8 of the plan requires decentralization of Government offices in the NCR region which is contrary to the proposal of creating an integrated vista of Government offices. It is further stated that proposal to alter central vista precincts does not reckon the mandate of Chapter-10 for conservation of built heritage.
23. It is urged that the Respondents have acted in an arbitrary manner and have violated Article 21 as well as the Doctrine of Public Trust by denying basic access to public/recreational spaces which are essential to life and liberty.
24. To buttress their submissions, the Petitioners have placed reliance upon Lal Bahadur v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/1742/2017 : (2018) 15 SCC 407 (paras 12, 13 and 15), Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and Ors. MANU/SC/0426/1991 : (1991) 4 SCC 54 (paras 23 and 24), R.K. Mittal and Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/1471/2011 : (2012) 2 SCC 232 (paras 48 and 49), Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Ors. v. Hiraman Sitaram Deorukhar and Ors. MANU/SCOR/84375/2017 : (2019) 14 SCC 411 (para 6) and Goel Ganga Developers India Private Limited v. Union of India Through Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests and Ors. MANU/SC/0841/2018 : (2018) 18 SCC 257.
25. In the counter affidavit filed by DDA, it is submitted that the proposal is merely meant to align the existing land use with the proposed plan for optimum utilisation whilst preserving and conserving environment and built heritage of the central vista precincts as a whole. As regards the contention of population density, it is submitted that the project is not going to result in any enhancement in population density as the area attracts floating population which brings in a temporary footprint during official working hours only.
26. As regards the absence of an updated ZDP, the Respondent DDA, in its counter affidavit, placed reliance upon Chapter-16 of the Master Plan to urge that such plan was not required at all as Chapter-16 expressly permits the usage of the previous plan. It is submitted that in the absence of an updated plan, the ZDP formulated under the previous Master Plan continues to be operative.
27. In the consolidated counter affidavit, the Respondents (Union of India) have urged that the changes indicated in the proposal regarding land use are in the nature of minor modifications and not substantial alterations of the Master Plan, as suggested. Responding to the argument of lack of authority, the Respondents have urged that the power of Central Government to propose modifications falling Under Section 11A(2) is not restricted as the limitations of Sub-section (1) are strictly meant for the Authority and do not apply to the Central Government as such. To buttress the submission, it is urged that the powers of Central Government Under Sub-section (2) are untrammelled and uninhibited by restrictions which apply to the Authority.
28. Countering the argument that DDA possessed no power to issue public notice, it is submitted in the written submissions that procedure prescribed under the Act requires DDA to publish notice inviting objections, be it for modification of the existing plan or for preparation of new Master Plan. Reference has been made to S.O. 141 : MANU/URBN/0004/2007 dated 7.2.2007 to support this view.
29. It is further urged in the written submissions that procedure prescribed by law has been strictly followed by the Authority. In that, the proposal was initiated by Land & Development Office-land owning agency-and was placed for due consideration of Technical Committee on 5.12.2019 before being finally placed before the Authority on 11.12.2019 wherein all recommendations of the Technical Committee were considered before approving the release of public notice. Appearing for the Respondents, learned Solicitor General has submitted that the above sequence of events reveals due application of mind and no ground for arbitrariness has been made out.
30. The Respondents, in addition to the arguments, have placed reliance upon Union of India and Anr. v. Cynamide India Ltd. and Anr. MANU/SC/0076/1987 : (1987) 2 SCC 720 (paras 4, 6, 7 and 14), Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Limited and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0249/1990 : (1990) 3 SCC 223 (paras 36 to 47), State of Punjab v. Tehal Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0002/2002 : (2002) 2 SCC 7 (paras 36 to 44), Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. v. Promoters and Builders Association and Anr. MANU/SC/0487/2004 : (2004) 10 SCC 796 (paras 2 to 5), Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited and Anr. v. Sai Renewable Power Private Limited and Ors. MANU/SC/0486/2010 : (2011) 11 SCC 34 (para 39), Tulsipur Sugar Co. Ltd. v. the Notified Area Committee, Tulsipur MANU/SC/0336/1980 : (1980) 2 SCC 295 (para 3, 5, 7 and 8), Sundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija and Ors. v. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra and Ors. MANU/SC/0040/1990 : (1989) 3 SCC 396 (para 2, 3, 5, 7, 15, 27 and 28), Bangalore Development Authority v. Aircraft Employees' Cooperative Society Limited and Ors. MANU/SC/0053/2012 : (2012) 3 SCC 442 (paras 2, 8, 9, 66, 67, 76 and 77) and Chairman, Indore Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure Industrial Coke & Chemicals Ltd. and Ors. MANU/SC/7706/2007 : (2007) 8 SCC 705 (paras 20, 42 and 87 to 90).
T.C. (C) No. 230/2020 [formerly W.P. (C) No. 1575 of 2020 before the High Court of Delhi]
31. The challenge in this petition is to the public notice dated 5.2.2020 and also the final notification dated 20.3.2020. The relevant extract of prayers read thus:
a) Issue a Writ in the nature of mandamus or any other Writ/Order/Direction thereby quashing the impugned public notice dated 05.02.2020 issued by the Respondent No. 1 herein and all consequential actions taken thereto;
b) Issue a Writ in the nature of mandamus or any other Writ/Order/Direction thereby quashing the impugned notification for change in land use dated 20.03.2020 issued by the Respondent No. 2 herein and all actions taken in furtherance thereof.
32. In response to the notice inviting objections/suggestions regarding the change in land use, a total of 1292 responses were received by the Authority. Thereafter, on 3.2.2020, the Authority sent emails and SMS to the objectors conveying about personal/public hearing on the said responses before the Board of Enquiry and Hearing12 scheduled for 6.2.2020 and 7.2.2020. Additionally, on 5.2.2020, the Authority also published a notice (impugned notice) in six leading newspapers having wide circulation informing about the said hearing. The objectors were asked to remain present for personal/public hearing as per the slot (time) allotted to objections clubbed on the basis of commonality of the issue(s) raised by them so as to hear them together. In response, only 42 persons appeared for the oral hearing. The hearings were concluded as per the Schedule published for that purpose.
33. Assailing the said notice, the Petitioners submit that the Respondents called the objectors for public hearing at short notice of only one day which effectively disabled most of the objectors from appearing as travel arrangements could not be made within such short period. It is submitted that short notice resulted in the denial of natural justice to the objectors and negated the very essence of the requirement of public consultation as envisaged in Section 11A of 1957 Act. To buttress this submission, it is urged that the impugned notice had the effect of reducing the hearing into a mere formality and violated the requirements of fair opportunity which is an essential facet of democratic decision making. It is further submitted that as many as 200 persons were called for oral submissions within a time slot of one hour, thereby rendering the hearing itself as meaningless and ineffective.
34. Mr. Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners further submitted that the Respondents did not place complete information regarding the proposed changes in public domain and without adequate information, it entailed in denial of opportunity of raising effective objections. Reliance has been placed upon a series of judgments to support the view that a Master Plan ought to be preceded by a comprehensive consultative exercise based on multiple parameters including population density, availability of open spaces etc.
35. To support their case, the Petitioners have made reference to M.C. Mehta v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0604/2018 : (2019) 12 SCC 720 (para 13 and 15 to 18), Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association v. Designated Authority and Ors. MANU/SC/0022/2011 : (2011) 2 SCC 258 (paras 16, 63, 77-80 and 83), State of U.P. and Ors. v. Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0563/1989 : (1989) 2 SCC 505 (para 64), Aruna Roy and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/1519/2002 : (2002) 7 SCC 368 (paras 7 and 8), Travancore Rayon Ltd. v. Union of India MANU/SC/0280/1969 : (1969) 3 SCC 868 (paras 7 and 12), Hanuman Laxman Aroskar v. Union of India MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8), Utkarsh Mandal v. Union of India, R.K. Mittal MANU/SC/1471/2011 : (2012) 2 SCC 232 (para 47), Rajendra Shankar Shukla and Ors. v. State of Chhattisgarh and Ors. MANU/SC/0802/2015 : (2015) 10 SCC 400 (paras 7, 38, 39, 103, 108 and 109), S.N. Chandrashekar and Anr. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. MANU/SC/8005/2006 : (2006) 3 SCC 208 (paras 31, 33 and 34), Lal Bahadur MANU/SC/1742/2017 : (2018) 15 SCC 407 (paras 12, 14 to 16, 24 and 26), Bangalore Medical Trust MANU/SC/0426/1991 : (1991) 4 SCC 54 (paras 13 and 23 to 29) and Virender Gaur and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/SC/0629/1995 : (1995) 2 SCC 577 (paras 7, 8 and 10).
36. To counter the aforesaid submissions, Respondent DDA, in its consolidated reply, has submitted that out of 1292 objections, 1156 were identical and even remaining objections raised similar issues. It is urged that personal communication in the form of emails and SMS was sent to the objectors at least 3 days before the date of hearing which constitutes reasonable time in the facts and circumstances of the case and thus, denial of principles of natural justice cannot be alleged. To buttress this submission, it is further submitted that apart from aforesaid communication, the notice of public hearing was also published in six leading newspapers to encourage participation.
37. Responding to the argument of lack of information in public domain before calling for objections, the consolidated reply states that each and every detail relating to the project was published on the official website of Authority (www.dda.org.in) and it was open to common public to access it at any point of time.
38. Learned Solicitor General, appearing for the Respondents, contended that there is no requirement of oral hearing in the 1957 Act or in the 1959 Rules and despite that the hearing was provided by the Authority as a measure of fairness and transparency. He further submitted that none of the heritage buildings is being adversely affected in the process.
39. In the written submissions filed by the Respondents, it is submitted that the argument of denial of natural justice cannot be sustained as modification of Master Plan and town planning are activities of a legislative character and in legislative functions, public hearing can be allowed only to the extent provided in the law unlike other administrative processes.
W.P. (C) No. 510/2020
40. Post the final notification of change in land use, the Special Advisory Group of Central Vista assembled at its 50th meeting to consider the agenda item-Proposed New Parliament Building at Plot No. 118 on 23.4.2020. The minutes of the said meeting were released on 30.4.2020 wherein "No Objection" was granted to the said proposal. The Petitioner herein seeks to challenge the said grant of "No Objection". Another challenge to the Office Memorandum dated 14.10.2019 issued by Works Division, MoHUA whereby the Central Vista Committee13 was reconstituted. The relevant prayers read thus:
I. Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction to Respondent No. 2 Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), calling for records and quashing the Minutes of Meeting of Central Vista Committee dated 30.04.2020 at the 5th Meeting of Special Advisory Group of Central Vista and Central Secretariat Central Vista Committee with Agenda Item-Proposed New Parliament Building at Plot No. 118 New Delhi which was held on 23rd April 2020; and/or
II. Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction to Respondent No. 2 Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), quashing Office Memorandum F. No. 6/21/2018/ADG (Works)/338-W-1 dated 14th October, 2019 which was reconstituted as a patently biased Central Vista Committee with obvious conflict of interest in the Central Vista Project.
41. In the additional written note submitted by the Petitioner, it is urged that the reconstitution of the CVC was done to rush through the proposals regarding the subject project without any impartial and objective scrutiny. It is submitted that the project proponent herein was Chief Architect (CPWD) and after reconstitution, the chairmanship of the Committee was entrusted to ADG (Works), CPWD, another officer of the project proponent, indicative of the fact that there was an apparent conflict of interest in the CVC. It is further urged that similar identity of the Project Proponent and Chairman subjugated the principle of Nemo Judex In Causa Sua. Referring to the minutes of the meeting, the Petitioner argues that the minutes reveal a clear non-application of mind on the part of this Committee as no reasons are supplied for the alleged "No Objection". To buttress this submission, it is urged that the Committee was originally envisaged to be a study group which was meant to advise the Government and contrary to this purpose, the Committee paid a mere lip service to their duty and failed to act as a study group.
42. It is further submitted that the said meeting was not convened in a proper manner as it was not attended by designated officers and various junior officers were present on their behalf to consider the proposal. It is further submitted that the prescribed quorum of the meeting was not complete as only 7 out of 12 members of the study group were present in the meeting, thereby leaving out 5 members belonging to independent non-Governmental organisations. As per the Petitioner's case, the absence of representation from non-Government organisations and presence of junior officers of the Government goes to show that there was no effective deliberation and application of mind.
43. The Petitioner further submits that detailed maps, drawings, scheme, layouts and other relevant documents of the subject project were not placed before the Committee and these documents were sine qua non for taking an informed decision regarding the proposal. The absence of consideration of the relevant material, argues the Petitioner, had vitiated the outcome of the meeting.
44. In the counter affidavit filed by Respondents, it is submitted that the CVC serves a limited purpose and is meant to study the development proposals submitted for its consideration and examine whether the proposal is in sync with the overall character of the region. It is submitted that the Committee has been reconstituted at various points of time in the past as per emerging needs and nomination to chairmanship is made on the basis of designation (ex-officio) irrespective of individual holder of office. As regards the absence of designated members, it is submitted that as a general practice, when some members are preoccupied with other engagements, their representatives from the same department/office are nominated and authorised to act on their behalf. As regards quorum, it is stated that no quorum is prescribed for the meetings of the Committee and in absence thereof, the standard quorum of 25% would suffice the requirement.
45. Regarding the conduct of meeting, the counter affidavit states that the online meeting was in tune with the standard Government protocol amidst the pandemic and it was aimed towards facilitation of participation without requiring the members to step out of their homes for the purpose of meeting. It is submitted that the grant of no objection by CVC was a prerequisite to further processing of the proposal and the entire project could not have been kept in abeyance by delaying the CVC meeting indefinitely amidst the uncertainties of the pandemic. The Respondents have also highlighted that the minutes of the meeting were sent to all the members (including the non-attendees) and no objections were raised by them nor received from any member concerning the propriety of the grant of no objection.
W.P.(C) No. 638/2020
46. The thrust of this petition is also on the "No Objection" dated 23.4.2020 granted by the CVC. The relevant prayer reads thus:
A. Issue a Writ in the nature of mandamus or any other Writ/Order/Direction thereby quashing "No-objection" granted by the Respondent No. 2 herein, being the Central Vista Committee, to the proposed New Parliament Building in its meeting dated 23.04.2020, which is reflected in the minutes of that meeting circulated on 30.04.2020 and all consequential actions taken thereto;
47. In addition to the grounds urged in W.P. (C) 510/2020, the Petitioners herein submit that the CVC was functioning under the chairmanship of ADG (Works) who is not an architect or town planner and thereby lacks the requisite skills/knowledge required for considering the said proposal. The argument is supplemented in the written submissions where it is stated that the nature of duties entrusted to CVC requires the head of the Committee to be a professional architect or town planner so as to consider the proposal in a nuanced manner. To buttress this submission, the Petitioners contend that the meeting was called despite absence of external experts and it was a deliberate step to avoid professional scrutiny of the professional, thereby rendering the said no objection as arbitrary and illegal.
48. The Petitioners have also pressed the argument of non-application of mind, akin to that taken in W.P. (C) 510/2020, on the ground that no assessment was made by the Respondents to consider the viability and need of a new Parliament building and the entire process was carried in undue haste. To buttress this argument, reliance has been placed upon Inderpreet Singh Kahlon and Ors. v. State of Punjab and Ors. MANU/SC/2433/2006 : (2006) 11 SCC 356 (paras 72 and 73) and Bahadursinh Lakhubhai Gohil v. Jagdishbhai M. Kamalia and Ors. MANU/SC/1065/2003 : (2004) 2 SCC 65 (paras 24 and 25) to urge that an action taken in undue haste could be declared as bad in law.
49. It is further submitted that CVC disregarded the legal framework for dealing with heritage structures. The Petitioners seek support from Clause 7.26 read with Annexure-II of Building Byelaws to contend that minimum changes are permissible on Grade-I heritage buildings/precincts and the Committee failed to take that into consideration. The said no objection is also assailed on the alleged failure of the Committee to take into consideration various factors concerning environmental impacts, traffic assessment etc.
50. During the hearing, Mr. Hegde, appearing for the Petitioners, submitted that CVC, though originally conceived as an advisory body, has assumed a statutory character owing to its long functioning and is expected to discharge pivotal role in development of such projects. In "Supplementary Note on the Role of Central Vista Committee" submitted by the Petitioners, reference is made to the notice inviting bids and Clause 6.4.3 of ZDP for Zone-D to support the view that CVC was envisaged as a statutory committee.
51. Alternatively, it is urged that the statutory mandate of CVC is in line with the doctrine of legitimate expectations in administrative matters. The Petitioners have relied upon National Buildings Construction Corporation v. S. Raghunathan and Ors. MANU/SC/0550/1998 : (1998) 7 SCC 66 to contend that this doctrine is premised on the ground of reasonableness and natural justice, and has now become a source of substantive as well as procedural rights.
52. In addition to cases noted above, the Petitioners have placed reliance upon R.S. Garg v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/8239/2006 : (2006) 6 SCC 430 (para 28), Council of Architecture v. Mukesh Goyal and Ors. and Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education v. K.S. Gandhi and Ors. MANU/SC/0583/1991 : (1991) 2 SCC 716 (paras 20 and 21).
53. The argument regarding the statutory character of CVC has been countered by learned Solicitor General. He would urge that it is merely an advisory body with a limited mandate to advise the Government on a proposal submitted for its consideration. It has no authority to grant approvals or take decisions. Further, merely because a body has been referred to in the ZDP (Zone-D) or has been working for a prolonged period, it will not assume a statutory character on its own until it is so provided by a statute.
54. As regards the argument of non-application of mind, it is submitted that CVC is not supposed to supply reasons for its approval in a manner akin to judicial/quasi-judicial bodies and the fact that CVC, in its decision, had asked the project proponent/CPWD to ensure that the project is in sync with the character of Central Vista reveals due application of mind. It is urged that application of mind must be revealed from a substantial compliance perspective. The Respondents have urged that the present case is a sui generis one and must be treated accordingly keeping in mind larger national interest. For brevity, other submissions of the Respondents to this prayer are not being repeated here.
W.P.(C) No. 681/2020 AND W.P. (C) No. 845/2020
55. On 12.2.2020, the project proponent (CPWD) filed application for EC for "Expansion and Renovation of Existing Parliament Buildings, New Delhi". The Expert Appraisal Committee14 considered the said application in its 49th meeting dated 25-26.2.2020. After examining details of the project, EAC noted that several objections have been received by the Committee as well as by the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change15 wherein various concerns have been expressed regarding the project. After underlining this information, the Committee deemed it appropriate to record the said objections and ask the project proponent to submit additional information for further deliberation. Thus, the proposal stood deferred. On 11.3.2020, CPWD responded to the Committee's observation for supplying additional material and submitted the relevant documents for consideration of the proposal. Form-I and Form-IA were also revised in light of the additional information sought by the Committee. In the revised form, details touching upon cost of project, total built-up area and number of trees were modified. The total cost of the Project was enhanced from Rs. 776 crores to Rs. 922 crores, total built-up area of the proposed Parliament was enhanced from 59,800 sq.m. to 65,000 sq.m., number of trees on plot No. 118 was enhanced from 326 to 333. In its 50th meeting on 22.4.2020, EAC considered the revised proposal and approved the same for grant of EC subject to certain specific conditions commensurate with the nature of subject project along with standard conditions of EC. Thereafter on 17.6.2020, the MoEF accepted the recommendations of EAC and granted EC to the proposal on Expansion and Renovation of Parliament building. This grant of EC stands impugned in these two petitions. The relevant extract of prayers read thus:
a. Pass an order in the nature of a Writ/Order quashing and setting aside the impugned Environmental Clearance dated 17.06.2020 issued by the Respondent No. 1 in respect to the project titled as "Expansion and Renovation of Existing Parliament Building at Parliament Street, New Delhi";
b. Pass an order in the nature of a Writ/Order calling for the records of the Environmental Clearance dated 17.06.2020 issued by the Respondent No. 1 and thereafter hold that the entire decision making process as carried out by the Expert Appraisal Committee in the build-up to the issuance of the Environmental Clearance dated 17.06.2020 is vitiated and accordingly set aside the same;
c. Pass an Order in the nature of a Writ/Order declaring that the subject project being Development/Redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista at New Delhi is a composite project for the purposes of seeking Environmental Clearance;
In addition to the aforesaid prayer for quashing the Clearance, the Petitioners in W.P. (C) 681/2020 have alleged a case of deliberate concealment of information and supply of misleading information in the proposals submitted for EC and prayed thus:
2. Direct action against Respondent No. 3 as Project Proponent for concealment of information and submission of false and misleading information; classifying the project as a Category B2 instead of Category B1; and a Schedule 8(a) project instead of 8(b); and obtaining Environment Clearance; which attracts conditions stipulated in Clause 8 of the EIA Notification of 2006, 'Grant of Rejection of Prior Environmental Clearance', and the penal conditions of sub Clause (vi); leading to cancellation of Environment Clearance.
56. The Petitioners in W.P. (C) 845/2020 have submitted that the EAC failed to apply its mind while considering the proposal and both the proposal and objections by various persons were treated in a mechanical manner. The submission is buttressed by placing reliance upon Hanuman Laxman Aroskar MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8), wherein this Court observed that EAC being an expert body must apply itself to every relevant aspect of the project and its bearing upon environment.
57. The Petitioners, in common rejoinder, have furthered the argument by contending that merely seeking certain clarifications from the project proponent is not sufficient compliance and it would only be upon a detailed scrutiny of the response/data/statements that the requirement of application of mind could be satisfied. It is added that the absence of a reasoned order by EAC advances the case of the Petitioners as administrative/quasi-judicial authorities cannot grant approvals without recording reasons.
58. To support this argument, it is submitted that EAC failed to note that the project proponent deliberately separated the Parliament project out of the larger Central Vista Project with an objective to lower the scrutiny level by considering it on a standalone basis. Due to this segregation, the project was categorised as B2 project (Building and Construction) in item 8(a); whereas a collective assessment of the project would make it fall in item 8(b) i.e., Township and Area Development, falling under category B1 in terms of the 2006 Environmental Impact Assessment16 Notification17. As a result of this categorisation, as contended, the Respondents unscrupulously did away with the requirements of preparing a comprehensive Terms of Reference (TOR), Scoping and EIA Report as these requirements do not apply to B2 category projects. To buttress this submission, it is added that it was only to bypass the comprehensive scrutiny that the Respondents characterised the proposal as a "renovation" and "expansion" project, instead of specifying that a whole new building with a built-up area measuring 65,000 sq.m. is being proposed alongwith the development of Central Vista precincts as a whole.
59. According to the Petitioners, the proposed Project is a single project with three components-Development/Redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista. The argument of deliberate disintegration and slicing of the project is further supported by referring to various documents of the Government wherein a single vision was projected by the Government viz.:
(i) CPWD notice inviting bids which referred to the project as "Development/Redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista at New Delhi.
(ii) Public notice of DDA dated 21.12.2019 inviting objections and suggestions proposed change in land use of 8 plots collectively.
(iii) MoHUA Press Release dated 25.10.2019 treats it as an integrated project as it reads:
With an aim of improving the old buildings on Raisina Hills, make improved Common Secretariat Buildings, refurbish old Parliament building, make new space for new requirement of MPs and upgrade the entire Central Vista area by revisiting entire Master Plan, a world class Consultant was required. ....
60. The Petitioners have relied upon OM dated 24.12.2010 issued by MoEF which refers to "Consideration of Integrated and Inter-linked projects" to urge that legal mandate requires collective appraisal of interlinked and integrated projects for the purpose of EC so that their cumulative impact can be assessed. To buttress the submission, it is urged that the said O.M. ought to be given a purposive meaning so as to procure comprehensive information on such projects in line with the objective of environmental protection. Reliance has been placed upon Alaknanda Hydropower Co. Limited v. Anuj Joshi and Ors. MANU/SC/0795/2013 : (2014) 1 SCC 769 to supplement the view that combined impact of a project must be considered to arrive at a true assessment of environmental impact. Emphasizing on the meaning of the phrase "cumulative impact", the Petitioners have relied upon the decision of NGT in T. Muruganandam v. Ministry of Environment & Forests18 to contend that cumulative assessment involves a holistic approach towards all present and reasonably foreseeable future activities so that actual impact on ecology can be determined.
61. It is further submitted that the Respondents wilfully concealed relevant information from the Expert Committee regarding cumulative effects, proximity to other existing or planned projects, etc. which would attract Clause 8(vi) of 2006 Notification pertaining to concealment of information and submission of false information. Reliance has again been placed upon Hanuman Laxman Aroskar MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8) to contend that submission of authentic information without any concealment is a basic expectation under the 2006 Notification and any clearance granted on the basis of a defective Form-I is liable to be rejected.
62. The Petitioners submit that the project proponent failed to conduct any assessment studies for examining the real impact of the project on environment. The Respondents' statement that the new Parliament building shall have minor and incremental impacts on the environment is alleged to be baseless and unfounded. It is urged that absent any scientific assessment to back its claim, the project proponent misinformed the expert committee and gave false assurances regarding impact on air pollution, noise pollution, geology, ecology and biodiversity. The Respondents' assurance on transplantation of trees is also assailed as baseless and lacking in substance as no study was conducted to determine the age, girth and species of the trees which are essential elements for examining the potential of survival of a transplanted tree.
63. The Petitioners further submit that the project proponent misinformed and misled the expert committee as regards the requirement of parking space and acted in violation of Master Plan which mandates a parking requirement of 1.8 ECS (Equivalent Car Space) per 100 sq.m. of built-up area. Contrary to this specification, parking space of 100 ECS was stated in the requirements for the proposed built-up area of 65,000 sq.m. which is grossly low.
64. Relying upon Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0686/1996 : (1996) 5 SCC 647 and A.P. Pollution Control Board II v. Prof. M.V. Nayudu (Retd.) and Ors. MANU/SC/2953/2000 : (2001) 2 SCC 62, the Petitioners have contended that EAC ought to have given regard to the precautionary principle during appraisal as it is attracted in all those cases where an identifiable risk of environmental degradation is present and thus, there was heavy burden on the project proponent to demonstrate the absence of environmental harm. In this case, the EAC could not have relied upon blanket assurances without undertaking any analysis as it would otherwise be a case of non-application of mind. The threshold submission is that the role of EAC under 2006 Notification is well carved out and in Hanuman Laxman Aroskar MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8), this Court had highlighted the importance of reasons and undertaking a detailed analysis of all environmental factors.
65. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners, further submitted that as per Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors. MANU/SC/0735/2011 : (2011) 7 SCC 338, doctrine of proportionality and non-application of mind standards can be invoked in environmental review cases and as per Hanuman Laxman Aroskar MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8), an in-depth merits review is mandated by the 2006 Notification and EAC failed to undertake the same. Thus, the Respondents are bound by these high standards and the entire matter needs to be examined on that basis by this Court.
66. The Petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 681/2020 has adopted similar submissions to assail the EC and they are not being repeated. Referring to Clause 7 of 2006 Notification, the Petitioner submitted that the notification contemplates four stages of EC for new projects and by showcasing this project as an "expansion" instead of new construction, the Respondents have evaded the crucial stages. It is further submitted that EAC ought to have considered the proposal in the light of principles of sustainable development, public trust and inter-generational equity.
67. To support their submissions, Petitioners have relied upon Keystone Realtors Private Limited v. Anil V. Tharthare and Ors. MANU/SC/1659/2019 : (2020) 2 SCC 66 (para 19), Bengaluru Development Authority v. Sudhakar Hegde and Ors., Sunil Kumar Chugh and Ors. v. Secretary, Environment Department, Government of Maharashtra and Ors.19, Samata and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors., Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi v. State of A.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/8047/2006 : (2006) 3 SCC 549 (paras 66 to 69, 72 to 76, 78 and 82), Common Cause v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0930/2017 : (2017) 9 SCC 499 (paras 208, 209 and 210), Sarpanch, Grampanchayat, Tiroda, Tal. Sawantwadi, District Sindhudurg, Maharashtra and Ors. v. Ministry of Environment & Forests and Ors. and Goel Ganga Developers India Private Limited MANU/SC/0841/2018 : (2018) 18 SCC 257 (para 17).
68. In counter affidavit filed by CPWD, it is submitted that the new Parliament building is being constructed adjacent to the existing building and both buildings will supplement each other in terms of functionality. Simultaneously, the existing building shall be retrofitted and renovated in accordance with the limitations prescribed for Grade-I structures and thus, the project was rightly named as an expansion and renovation project.
69. It is submitted that in terms of 2006 Notification, no detailed EIA is required for building projects with built-up area of less than 1,50,000 sq.m. as they fall under category 8(a), and since the built-up area of subject project is less than 1,50,000 sq.m., no such assessment is required as per the notification and thus, EAC was right in not insisting for any such impact assessment. Learned Solicitor General, would further submit that categorisation as 8(a) or 8(b) would not be of much consequence as the nature of categorisation causes no prejudice in considering the cumulative impact of the project on environment, if any. To buttress this submission, it is urged that as per the mandate of law, a detailed EIA would be carried out for the Central Secretariat project as it falls under category 8(b) i.e., Township and Area Development. Such assessment, as per law, would examine land use within the radius of 10km and since Parliament falls within these dimensions, environmental concerns (if any) associated with it may also be addressed in the same assessment and additional mitigating measures could be imposed.
70. To the argument that both these projects are integrated projects calling for a collective appraisal, the counter affidavit states that the expression "Integrated Projects" refers to those projects that cannot exist without each other to the extent that their existence as well as functionality is inevitably dependent upon each other. In present case, submitted the Respondents, both these projects are marked by different timelines, different budgetary allocations, different wings of the Union of India (Parliament and Executive) and also for different utilities. In that, Parliament project is supposed to culminate in 2022, the other project may go on till 2026. It is further urged that budgetary allocation for Parliament project is made by Lok Sabha Secretariat and that for North/South Block project is made by Ministry of Culture. To further justify separate EC application for Parliament project, the consolidated reply states that as a matter of practice, EC is not given merely on the basis of preliminary vision/Master Plan and such application ought to be made for those projects only for which detailed drawings, planning layouts etc. are available so that an informed impact assessment (site specific) can be made. The central secretariat project has not reached that stage yet. The submission reads thus:
8....Therefore, an application for Environment Clearance can be made effectively and accurately only in the final stages of the planning and execution of a project and not at a broad macro level without mentioning the minute details of the project.
71. Learned Solicitor General urged that merely because the project was mentioned in the comprehensive project and in the bid document for engagement of the Consultant, it does not mean that the project proponent is obliged to treat it as a whole for all future purposes. Whereas, the Government is well within its rights to even drop the plan of Central Secretariat project without impacting the Parliament project. It is urged that expansion/renovation of Parliament and development of new Central Secretariat in that sense are two distinct projects and attract different procedural compliances under law before the construction thereof commences, as stated in the written submissions thus:
20. It is submitted that carrying out architectural and engineering planning of all the components through a single consultant with a view to benefit from cost and planning efficiencies does not automatically mean that the Parliament project and the remaining Central Vista redevelopment projects are, for the purposes of an environment clearance, is a single project. It is submitted that Parliament Project and the remaining Central Vista redevelopment are different projects and the planning in respect of such projects is carried out in different stages. It is submitted that execution of the different projects shall be taken up in phases...
72. It is submitted that the total built-up area of the proposed Parliament building is 65,000 sq.m. whereas that of proposed Central Secretariat is approximately 17 lakh sq.m. and it was a conscious policy decision of the competent authority to treat the Parliament project as an independent one being most urgent and to prevent it from falling prey to delays owing to the vast territorial expanse of the comprehensive plan. Thus, the conscious decision of the Government is to ensure completion of building project in a smooth manner and not to link it up with the town development project.
73. The contention regarding non application of mind by EAC has been countered by Respondent MoHUA in its reply affidavit wherein it is submitted that EAC comprises of scientific experts who have been considering proposals for EC for past 1.5 years. It is submitted that detailed deliberation took place in the 49th EAC meeting after which supplementary information was sought in a revised Form-1/1A regarding scope of renovation of existing building, status of pending cases, traffic management plan, response to objections received from public, updated Master Plan showing land use of plot No. 118 and accordingly, entire information was placed before the Committee and the same was duly considered in the next meeting before formulating its recommendation. Thus, application of mind is writ large in the entire process. As regards the allegation of fraud and misrepresentation while providing information regarding connected projects in Form-I, the written submissions state that O.M. dated 24.12.2010, relied upon by the Petitioners to extend this argument, was misconceived as the concept of inter-linked projects is used in reference to multi-sectoral projects and the subject project does not involve a multi-sectoral component and is a standalone building construction project.
74. In written submissions filed by the Respondents, it is further submitted that a detailed study was conducted to identify the possible impacts of the proposed project and concerns relating to air emissions, water, soil etc. were duly addressed by EAC by prescribing an Environment Management Plan (EMP) and operational measures. It is informed that measures including setting up of sewage treatment plant at the site, usage of recycled water, rain water storage tanks, usage of recycled material, solid waste management etc. shall be followed.
75. Learned Solicitor General has sought to distinguish the judgment of this Court in Hanuman Laxman Aroskar MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8) by contending that in the said case, the analysis was done in context of a Category-A project and moreover, the view of the Court as regards the requirement of reasons was in the context of the facts of that case. It is submitted that as per the 2006 Notification, reasons are required only in cases of rejection of objections and not in all cases. To buttress this submission, the argument advanced in W.P. (C) 638/2020 that decisions taken by experts are not akin to those taken by judicial/quasi-judicial bodies has been reiterated.
W.P. (C) No. 853/2020
76. On 2.9.2019, the Respondent CPWD invited bids vide NIT No. 04/CPM/RPZ/NIT/2019-20 from national/international design and planning firms for appointment of Consultant (Consultancy Services) for a comprehensive architectural and engineering planning for development/redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista. The minimum eligibility criteria required the bidders to have an average annual turnover of Rs. 20 crores from consultancy services in India. On 4.9.2019, the Indian Institute of Architects20 gave a representation to the Respondent raising certain objections to the eligibility conditions in the tender document. The Council of Architecture, on 9.9.2019, also raised similar objections and called for an Open Design Competition. On 12.9.2019, a pre-bid meeting was held for the interested parties for clarifications regarding the NIT. After the pre-bid meeting discussion, CPWD released a corrigendum and addendum to Consultation Services NIT whereby, the date of online submission was extended from 23.9.2019 to 30.9.2019 and sum of earnest money was reduced to Rs. 25 lakhs. After this process, five firms qualified for technical bids and four firms qualified for financial bids. On 25.10.2019, MoHUA announced that M/s. HCP Designs has been awarded the Consultation Services NIT for the development of entire Central Vista region. This was followed by DDA's public notice for change in land use, public hearing on objections, final notification of change in land use and grant of no objection by CVC at relevant points of time as already discussed above.
77. On 5.6.2020, Delhi Urban Art Commission21, in its 1542nd meeting considered the proposal for Parliament project and recorded various observations regarding urban form, aesthetics, integration of old building with proposed old building, incorporation of green building features etc. Thereafter, on 1.7.2020 (1544th meeting), DUAC considered a revised building plan proposal submitted by the project proponent and granted its approval along with some observations regarding parking requirements, public art, skylights and height of the building.
78. The Petitioners herein seek to raise a comprehensive challenge to the project by assailing various stages of the project elaborated above. The relevant extract of the prayers read thus:
a. A declaration that the Central Vista Project including but not limited to the Parliament building is ultra vires the Constitution of India and is illegal, null and void;
b. A declaration that a project for redesigning the Central Vista including Parliament building may be carried out (i) only pursuant to an objective and independent assessment made after stakeholder consultation which confirms the necessity for such a project; (ii) through a widely publicized Open Design Competition; (iii) by adopting a transparent process with adequate timelines that enable wide participation in the consultancy, design and execution phases; and (iv) through the selection of the design by a representative and independent jury;
c.

79. Appearing for the Petitioners, Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel supported by Ms. Vrinda Bhandari and Mr. Gautam Bhatia, learned Counsel, submits that this petition seeks to interrogate the State at a very fundamental level so as to enforce the principle of "Rule of Law" as distinguished from "Rule by Law". Broadly, it is the Petitioners' case that the Respondents have followed the principle of "Rule by Law" right from the stage of conception of the subject project and have failed to comply with the idea of substantive due process including in obtaining various approvals and clearances for the same. As is manifest from the aforesaid prayer, the Petitioners have called upon this Court to issue suitable declarations relating to democratic due process, standards of transparency, public consultation and procedural fairness in a project of this nature and importance.
80. In addition to grounds already urged with respect to common prayers in previous petitions, the primary submission of the Petitioners herein is that any decision to change or renovate the Parliament building ought to be preceded by widest public consultation as it is an essential feature of democratic due process. The Petitioners contend that a project of this nature should be backed by a legislation and even if the same is not made, the executive Government is bound to work under the contours of a limited Government ensuring minimum standards of stakeholder consultation, transparency, fair competition, adequate participation time and excellence in design. Reliance has been placed upon State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr. v. Thakur Bharat Singh MANU/SC/0043/1967 : AIR 1967 SC 1170 to contend that there are well recognised constitutional limitations on the Government of the day. The manner of consultation, as envisaged by the Petitioners in writ petition and rejoinder to consolidated reply, involves two elements-consultation with expert agencies and consultation with common public.
81. The argument regarding lack of expert consultation states that the Respondents failed to consult Heritage Conservation Committee22 which is an expert body in matters involving heritage structures and ought to have been consulted right from the stage of conception of the project. It is contended that even before the design is freezed, the project proponent was obliged to consult HCC. For, as it would be of no use to consult it after the procedure is complete and development work is about to commence. It is submitted that the Respondents have violated their obligation to protect and conserve the heritage as per globally accepted international principles. It is submitted that principles of adaptive re-use and minimal impact must be adhered to and any operation of restoration or modification ought to be considered as a special operation to be compulsorily preceded by a detailed archaeological and historical study. It is added that non-adherence to due procedure in the present case is also violative of Article 49 which, being a Directive Principle, is meant to be fundamental in the governance of the country. Similarly, consultation with other bodies such as DUAC and CVC was not only inadequate and arbitrary but also delayed as it ought to have been done at the plan conception stage itself. It is urged that the tender document called upon the consultant to make a new Master Plan for Central Vista without undertaking any assessment by expert bodies such as HCC or CVC. It is further contended that CPWD ought to have conducted a physical audit of heritage structures and called for views of special committee of Parliament. To buttress this submission, it is further submitted in written submissions that post 2015, no Parliamentary Committee has had examined the prospects of repairing the existing structure or the need for transformation of the entire Central Vista.
82. The Petitioners invited our attention to the Parliament Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act, 2019 passed by UK Parliament to contend that this comprehensive legislation reflects the best practices adopted by other democracies while undertaking projects of this nature.
83. Assailing the decision of DUAC, the Petitioners have argued that the Commission acted in a manner contrary to its statutory scheme as per Memorandum No. 1(2)/82-DUAC dated 7.7.2005 which enjoins it with the duty of preservation. As a statutory body, the Petitioners submit, the Commission ought to have considered the impact of this project on heritage by conducting a thorough study and it failed to fulfil its mandate by not doing so. This mandate is borne from Section 11 of the Delhi Urban Art Commission Act, 197323 which enjoins the Commission with a duty to advise the Government and lay down guidelines for the local bodies. The Petitioners submit that this duty to advise must continue at all stages of the process including the pre-tender stage.
84. While taking exception to the No Objection granted by CVC, the Petitioners' stand is similar to that taken in W.P. (C) 638/2020 as has been set out hitherto. Hence, the same is not reiterated for brevity. The primary submission pertains to non-application of mind, absence of reasons, mechanical approval and abdication of real duty envisaged for CVC.
85. In addition to arguments set forth in previous petitions regarding need for empirical data, the Petitioners herein have placed reliance upon K.S. Puttaswamy (Retired) and Anr. (II) v. Union of India and Anr. MANU/SC/1054/2018 : (2019) 1 SCC 1 and Internet and Mobile Association of India v. Reserve Bank of India MANU/SC/0264/2020 : (2020) 10 SCC 274 in the written submissions to reiterate the need for proper/empirical independent studies before taking actions in larger public interest. Reference has been made to Internet and Mobile Association MANU/SC/0264/2020 : (2020) 10 SCC 274 to support the view that empirical data is essential to understand the degree of harm and a decision based on lack of proper studies must fail the test of proportionality. The requirement of conducting proper scientific studies is also borne from Article 9 and 10 of Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, 1964.
86. Advancing the argument regarding direct public consultation, the Petitioners have stated that the concept of participatory democracy demands that a project of this nature must involve the common public as they are the real stakeholders of national heritage and must be consulted at every stage of the project including prior to drawing outline of the project, releasing consultancy tender, modifying the Master Plan and finalisation of the design and making changes therein. Reliance has been placed upon Hanuman Laxman Aroskar MANU/SC/0444/2019 : (2019) 15 SCC 401 (para 112.8) and Clause 1.3 of Annexure-II of UBBL to contend that the mandate of law requires inviting suggestions from public and consideration thereof by the expert bodies before granting any permission. To buttress this submission, Mr. Divan has contended that the nature of Indian democracy envisages public participation at the most fundamental level of decision making. Placing reliance upon Cellular Operators Association of India and Ors. v. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0551/2016 : (2016) 7 SCC 703, it is submitted that CPWD ought to have followed a three-step process including-stakeholder consultation, inviting submissions from stakeholders, full documentation of all decisions supported with reasons. Further reliance has been placed upon K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. (I) v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/1044/2017 : (2017) 10 SCC 1 to contend that akin to privacy, democracy is also a travelling right which travels across all tenets and all stages of the project.
87. The written submissions of Petitioners state that right to public participation and consultation is a pre-requisite for consequential state action and it flows from 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It is submitted that this requirement is born out of reasonableness and State is under a constitutional duty to take affirmative measures to ensure maximum participation. It is urged that what extent of participation may be reasonable in a given case may be determined on a case-to-case basis keeping in mind certain parameters including-scope and public importance of State action, urgency involved, availability of forums to engage with public, efficacy of public participation etc.
88. The Petitioners, in written submissions, have supported the idea of wide public participation by drawing strength from comparative constitutional position on the subject-matter in other jurisdictions. Reliance has been placed upon Doctors for Life International v. Speaker of the National Assembly and Ors. MANU/SACC/0028/2006 : 2006 (12) BCLR 1399, delivered by the Constitutional Court of South Africa, wherein an express provision providing for public consultation was considered to be a practical and symbolic part of the democratic process. While describing the nature and scope of such right, the Petitioners adopt observations from para 98 of the judgment wherein indirect participation through elected representatives and direct participation by public are both recognized as essential tenets of democracy. Additionally, the Petitioners also submit that in Doctors for Life International MANU/SACC/0028/2006 : 2006 (12) BCLR 1399, the right to political participation is recognized even beyond the express provision by referring to various international and regional human rights instruments.
89. Mr. Divan, in order to advance the submission on public participation, placed further reliance upon the decision of Court of Appeal, Kenya in Kiambu County Government and Ors. v. Robert N. Gakuru and Ors.24 wherein public participation was envisaged both quantitatively and qualitatively. While enunciating the concept of participatory democracy, the Court in Kiambu County24 further observed that arms-length democracy is not participatory democracy.
90. The Petitioners, in Rejoinder to Third Consolidated Reply filed by the Respondents, submit that public participation is premised on the principle of democratic due process which requires the fulfilment of at least six basic parameters:
(i) decision based upon extensive debate and discussion;
(ii) Robust statutory framework laying out specific obligations of different bodies involved in the process;
(iii) Budgetary control through Parliament;
(iv) Public portal for continuous exchange with public and stakeholders;
(v) No substantial alteration of heritage;
(vi) Disclosure and transparency.
91. To conclude, the Petitioners have submitted a set of principles which can be termed as essential features of "consultation" in any such process and we reproduce the same for clarity of thought and better consideration of the case thus:
(a) There are two sets of parties involved-
(1) the proposer, upon whom a duty to consult has been cast-in this case, the State, acting through the Respondents; and
(2) the stakeholder, who has a claim to be consulted and whose input is sought-in this case, the entire citizenry of India, represented non-exclusively through the Writ Petitioners.
(b) There must be a 'meeting of minds' between the proposer and the stakeholder;
(c) The precursors for an effective 'meeting of minds' are that the stakeholder must be: (1) provided all relevant materials available to the proposer, and (2) given sufficient time to prepare its response;
(d) The parties must 'deliberate' upon the subject matter, such that there is full and meaningful communication of each party's proposals and counter-proposals, and the parties 'make their respective points of view known to the others' and 'discuss and examine the relative merits of their views'; and
(e) While a consensus is not necessary, the minimum preference is for there to be a 'satisfactory solution' for all concerned. It is submitted that the Central Vista Project has failed to meet these requirements.
92. The Petitioners, in written submissions, have adopted a ground similar to that taken in T.C. (C) 230/2020 to contend that availability of information is essential for public consultation. Mr. Divan has submitted that the opaque manner in which various steps of this project have proceeded has jeopardized the citizens' right to know, which is considered to be fundamental Under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution as per Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (I) MANU/SC/1044/2017 : (2017) 10 SCC 1 and State of U.P. v. Raj Narain and Ors. MANU/SC/0032/1975 : (1975) 4 SCC 428 as well as under the broad spirit of the Constitution. Further reliance has been placed upon Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Proprietors of Indian Express Newspapers, Bombay Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. MANU/SC/0412/1988 : (1988) 4 SCC 592 to contend that right to know is also traceable from Article 21. It is urged that any modification/alteration/renovation with respect to structures like Parliament that reflect living heritage of the country must be undertaken in a manner wherein the voice of common public is recognised. To buttress this submission, it is argued that unless public is made aware of Government actions, it would not be in a position to question such actions and democratically participate in the decision-making process.
93. Regarding Respondent No. 9 (Consultant) as well, the Petitioners submit that it is an agent of the State and is duty bound to adopt practices and procedures akin to the State including public consultation with respect to design, architecture, heritage impact etc.
94. In order to assail Consultation Services NIT, the Petitioners contend that it undermined the principles of fair competition and prevented international firms from applying. The fact that six bidders applied for the tender demonstrates unfairness of the process. It is urged that an Open Design Competition ought to have been organized by the project proponent as it is a standard practice across the world. As per global standards, the Petitioners have submitted, such competitions entail three basic norms-a two-part open competition, competition to be judged by jury (with citizen participation), encouragement of widest participation. Various domestic examples were also cited-including of National War Memorial and Indira Gandhi National Center for Arts-to demonstrate how an open design competition is the standard norm.
95. The Petitioners contend that Consultation Services NIT was issued in violation of existing heritage conservation Regulations as it called for redevelopment of entire area including demolition and construction of buildings which is violative of Clause 7.26, UBBL 2016 which specifies that no changes other than prolonging the life of the heritage structures are permissible. The argument is on similar lines with those taken already in W.P. (C) Nos. 638/2020 and 845/2020 and is not being elaborated.
96. The Petitioners have further submitted that no estimated cost of project was provided in the tender document which is not only arbitrary but also violative of Rule 182 of General Finance Rules, 2017 which envisages for an estimation of reasonable expenditure. It is submitted that consultation NIT sought to employ a Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) system while at the same time, inviting bids on a cost percentage basis which effectively made it impossible to rank different bids in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. The provision regarding percentage-based fee has also been alleged to be contrary to Clause 3.4.2 of Manual of Procurement of Consultancy & Services (Ministry of Finance) which discourages percentage-based fee as it lacks incentive for economic design.
97. Advancing the ground of public trust adopted in previous petitions, in this petition as well, Mr. Divan has stoutly contended that the Respondents have compromised with the doctrine of public trust while proceeding with this project. Placing reliance upon M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath and Ors. MANU/SC/1007/1997 : (1997) 1 SCC 388, it is submitted that a transient Government holds the resources in trust for the public and they can only be utilised for the benefit of public. It is further submitted that under American law (Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. People of the State of Illinois [MANU/USSC/0300/1892 : 146 US 387 : 36 L Ed 1018 (1892)]) as well, the public trust doctrine extends to properties which are of "special consequence" and extending the same logic, it is urged that Central Vista is of special consequence for the nation, thereby calling for a high threshold of due process. To further the argument of suppression of public trust, it is urged that the bid document reveals that the decision of constructing a new Parliament building or to renovate the existing building was left to be decided by the private consultant and entrusting a private consultant with a fundamental decision of this nature does not fall in sync with the principles of public trust.
98. In addition to cases noted above, the Petitioners have placed reliance upon I.R. Coelho (Dead) by LRs. v. State of T.N. MANU/SC/0595/2007 : (2007) 2 SCC 1 (paras 48, 109, 139-141 and 151), Government (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India and Anr.

99. The Respondents have filed elaborate written submissions to respond to Petitioners' arguments on the concept of democracy, as it exists in India and democratic due process as envisaged under the Constitution. It is contended that the manner of public participation in India is through the representative mode, as we have adopted the representative model of governance. It is submitted that the public elects its representatives and the Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament. To buttress this argument, the written submissions state that a necessary element of democratic process is that directly elected persons represent true will of the people and they must take decisions that affect the people.
100. The Respondents have contended that the principle of Rule of Law, as envisaged in India, requires due adherence to existing statutory and constitutional principles. To include imaginary steps in the process of decision making by democratically elected representatives would be antithetical to the Rule of Law. It is urged in written submissions that the nature of participatory process proposed by the Petitioners is akin to a referendum. Such process is not envisaged under our Constitution.
101. To demonstrate ample consultation within Lok Sabha Secretariat, the Respondents have placed a short affidavit on General Purpose Committee26 which states that the idea of GPC, originally constituted for the first time on 26.11.1954, was to enable the Presiding Officer/Speaker to take into confidence all members of the House irrespective of party lines while considering matters relating to the affairs of the House. Learned Solicitor general has further submitted that the need for this project was expressed by the then Speaker of Lok Sabha in writing vide letter dated 9.12.2015. In 2019, another letter was addressed by the present Speaker to the Prime Minister. Furthermore, separate presentations were conducted by the officials of the concerned departments before Speaker of Lok Sabha and Chairman of Rajya Sabha i.e., Vice-President of India in order to apprise them about the project. It is submitted in the affidavit that GPC for 17th Lok Sabha was constituted on 21.11.2019 and present composition of the said Committee has representation from the following national political parties; whose members were elected representatives in the Parliament:
• Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)
• Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)
• All India Trinamool Congress (AITC)
• Indian National Congress (INC)
• Shiv Sena (SS)
• Biju Janata Dal (BJD)
• Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
• Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJSP)
• Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP)
• Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS)
• Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSR Congress Party)
• Janata Dal (United) (JDU)
• Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
• Samajwadi Party (SP)
102. It is submitted that a detailed presentation was made before GPC on 19.3.2020. The meeting was attended by Members of Parliament being representatives of prominent national political parties having presence in the Lok Sabha, one Special Invitee, six Secretariat members, Secretary and Joint Secretary of MoHUA, Dr. Bimal Patel, Director, HCP Designs, and was chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha (Chairperson of GPC). The aforesaid persons were present during the presentation regarding the new Parliament Building project. Furthermore, the budgetary considerations were placed before the relevant committee comprising of members across party lines and no objections is placed on record. Therefore, it would be wrong to allege that Parliament was kept in the dark regarding the project.
103. Responding to the contention that a legislation ought to have been passed for this purpose, the Respondents have submitted that there was no constitutional requirement to adopt the legislative route as construction projects can be carried out in discharge of executive functions.
104. The Respondents have specifically addressed in the written submissions that extensive reliance on foreign decisions may not be useful in the Indian context. In any case, that cannot be made the basis to answer the matters in issue. It is urged that the precedents relied upon by the Petitioners had dealt with express statutory provisions for public participation, as applicable in the concerned country, and judicial opinion was rendered in that specific context. Besides, these precedents deal with prior public participation in legislative action. That is entirely different than extending similar public participation in the matter of executive and administrative functions such as planning and development of a national project, in absence of any statutory requirement in that regard.
105. As regards approval by DUAC, the Respondents, in consolidated reply, have submitted that every local body in Delhi is required to procure approval by DUAC, which is a statutory body meant to advise and guide the Government on matters submitted to it. It is submitted that as per Section 11 of the DUAC Act, the proposal must be submitted for scrutiny by DUAC in respect of any project of building operations or engineering operations or any development proposal. It is stated that considering different stages for different components of the project, DUAC approval as regards the Parliament project has been obtained whereas the approval for rest of central vista precincts shall be taken as and when the development activity thereat is proposed in future. As regards application of mind, it is stated that the proposal was first considered by the committee in its 1542nd meeting dated 5.6.2020 wherein it was deferred due to insufficient information as regards vehicular parking plan and landscape plan. Thereafter, a revised proposal was placed before the committee in its 1545th meeting dated 1.7.2020 wherein it had been approved. It is further submitted that the minutes of the committee reveal that all representations concerning heritage, parking, landscape etc. were placed before the committee and duly considered by it while granting approval. To buttress this submission, it is urged that the minutes were ratified by the committee in its 1547th meeting on 10.7.2020 and no amendments were suggested by any member at the time of such ratification.
106. As regards the preservation of heritage structures and permission of HCC, in addition to grounds already urged above, the Respondents submit that no heritage structure is being affected in the entire project. In the written submissions, it is stated that heritage conservation does not prohibit improving the heritage structures by taking necessary action for increasing their life. The genesis of this argument could be understood by reproducing the following extract form para 150 of the written submissions:
150....The present project represents not a radical break from the past so as to lean on the future, rather entails a judicious policy attempt to conserve the delicate heritage and historical value of the area whilst allowing room for growth and development for future generations. ....
107. It is further submitted that as per relevant laws, permission would be required only for retrofitting of existing Parliament building and no such prior permission is needed for the construction of new building in the neighbouring independent plot, without affecting the existing heritage Parliament building. Reliance has been placed upon Annexure-II of UBBL to show that Regulations on development/redevelopment are only for listed buildings and even for such buildings, no such approval from HCC is needed at the planning stage. All such approvals are required at the development stage only. To buttress this submission, it is urged that the mandate of HCC is limited to buildings only and it does not concern the areas adjacent to such buildings. As far as area is concerned, DUAC is empowered to consider such changes and grant approval and accordingly, it has already granted its approval, as aforesaid.
108. Repelling the challenge to Consultation Services NIT on the ground of limited competition, it is submitted that both national and international design firms were invited to participate in the process and widest choice was given to applicants to encourage participation. It is urged that the requirement of prior experience of Government work was consciously provided for to ensure that the firm is capable of working in the administrative framework of Government. The Respondents have also contended that even if any irregularity could be pointed out in the tender process, none of the participants raised any grievance as regards the same and the Petitioners have no locus to escalate it at this stage by way of a public interest litigation.
109. On the alleged irregularities in percentage-based fee mechanism, it is submitted that the apprehension regarding percentage-based fee for consultancy services is not sustainable as the consultancy fee was consciously pegged by the Government vide corrigendum dated 23.9.2019 and thus, there was no incentive left for the consultant to escalate the cost of the project.
110. Addressing the contention of heightened judicial review in this case, the Respondents, in addition to grounds already urged in T.C. (C) 229/2020, have submitted that the subject project involves a set of policy decisions, namely-construction of new Parliament, location of proposed structure, common Central Secretariat, treating them as mutually independent projects and to achieve these objectives without impinging upon heritage. It is urged that the scope of judicial review must be limited to the examination of violation of statutory and constitutional principles and theoretical and academic questions need not be entertained or invoked for striking down policy decisions otherwise in compliance with the statutory provisions and mandate of the Constitution. The Respondents, in their written submissions, have placed reliance upon Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (II) MANU/SC/1054/2018 : (2019) 1 SCC 1 to contend that the expression "procedure established by law" connotes a fair and reasonable procedure and it cannot be equated with the due process Clause, as understood and applied in the American constitutional scheme. Reliance has been placed upon Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration MANU/SC/0184/1978 : (1978) 4 SCC 494 and Rajbala and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/SC/0877/2015 : (2016) 1 SCC 463 to contend that this Court has expressly rejected the existence of substantive due process under the Constitution. To buttress this submission, it is submitted that judicial review in India, in context of Article 13, is to be understood in reference to actual violation of any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.
111. Learned Solicitor General has submitted that the entire case of the Petitioners merely presents an alternative and to choose between available alternatives is not within the domain of judicial review. It is urged that when appeal is made to the Court on flimsy and abstract grounds which are incapable of any precise definition, the Court must be cautious and must interpret in line with the language of the Constitution. Reliance has been placed upon Keshavan Madhava Menon v. State of Bombay MANU/SC/0020/1951 : AIR 1951 SC 128 to advance this proposition. It is also submitted that if procedure has been complied with substantially and in a broad sense and application of mind is duly revealed, then no minute enquiry is called for on the basis of exposition in Lafarge Umiam Mining MANU/SC/0735/2011 : (2011) 7 SCC 338.
112. Addressing the contention regarding public trust, the Respondents categorically submit that they are principally in agreement with the notion that a Government ought to act in accordance with public trust. However, this doctrine does not prohibit the Government from utilising the resources held in public trust for the advancement of public interest itself.
113. Responding to the contention that Respondents compromised with public trust by entrusting the decision of new construction/renovation to the consultant, it is submitted that the task of making a Master Plan or of deciding whether or not a new building is required was never entrusted to the consultant and it was a conscious decision taken by the Government after consultation with all relevant entities. The Consultation NIT merely called upon the prospective bidders to prepare a vision document which could be used to understand the vision of the bidders regarding the project and scrutinize their applications on that basis and therefore, it cannot be said that Government abdicated its duty. The consultant was merely to advise whether renovation would suffice or a new structure would be imminent and final decision regarding all aspects of the project rested with the Government.
114. To support their position, the Respondents have placed reliance upon Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0640/2000 : (2000) 10 SCC 664 (paras 226 to 235), Shimnit Utsch India Private Limited and Anr. v. West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited and Ors.

115. Appearing for Respondent No. 9 (Consultant), Mr. Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel stoutly contends that allegations of bias and favouritism have been made by the Petitioners which colourises this challenge as one based on malice in fact. That allegation cannot proceed further in absence of the person against whom such case of bias is pleaded, by name. It is submitted that the virtue of participatory democracy is laudable but the extent and nature of participation cannot be enforced through the medium of judicial review. Mr. Salve argues that participatory democracy is a two-tier process of which a major element is Parliamentary law making which is done through the representative mode in India and not by a referendum. It is submitted that the nature of participation envisaged in India requires participation without causing hindrance in the system. It is for the Government to decide who is to be heard, for instance, in EC issues, only local affected people are meant to be heard.
116. It is further urged that even arguably, mere absence of sufficient participation would not be capable of being termed as Wednesbury unreasonableness so as to quash the whole process. Further, the argument of participatory democracy in respect of important decisions to be taken by the Government such as in respect of construction of a new Parliament building, if accepted, would be forcing the judiciary to define the type of Government decisions where such procedure need to be followed by applying the same logic. That will be groping in the dark and by no standards a judicial function. In that, same logic may then be invoked to compel the Government of the day to undertake public participation before going for a war on the fronts due to aggression by the neighbouring country, which is more important than a decision to construct a new Parliament building.
117. Mr. Salve submits that the scope of judicial review should be focussed on two enquiries only-first, whether there is any illegality or infraction of any statutory mandate and second, whether there is any procedural unfairness which can be checked by judicially manageable standards. As regards the lack of information in public domain, it is submitted that it is one thing to place information in public domain, but it does not mean that mere absence of information would render the decision as vitiated.
118. To buttress his submissions, Mr. Salve placed reliance upon Aruna Roy MANU/SC/1519/2002 : (2002) 7 SCC 368 (paras 7 and 8).
W.P.(C) No. 922/2020
119. On 17.10.2017, the MoHUA, while acting Under Section 11A of 1957 Act, had issued notification S.O. 3348(E) : MANU/HAUA/0017/2017 whereby Chapter-17 (Clause 8(2)) of Master Plan "Permission of Use Premises in Use Zones" was modified to permit the usage of land allocated for Public/Semi Public (PSP) usage for the purpose of Government offices. The said notification is assailed by the Petitioners herein with the following prayer:
i. Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction calling for records and for quashing the Notification S.O. 3348 (E) : MANU/HAUA/0017/2017 dated 17.10.2017, promulgated by Respondent No. 1 being ultra vires the power under the Delhi Development Authority Act of 1957, and in violation of Article 14 and 21 of Constitution of India;
120. In addition to grounds urged in T.C. (C) 229/2020, it is submitted that the said notification violates the tenets of Wednesbury Principle of Reasonableness and can be assailed on the three grounds of-illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. The Petitioners submit that the notification was the result of a colourable exercise of power and no such power vested with the Respondents so as to permit the usage of land for uncontemplated purposes.
121. To support their case, the Petitioners have relied upon Syed Hasan Rasul Numa and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0178/1991 : (1991) 1 SCC 401 (paras 11 to 14), Mackinonn Mackenzie & Co. Limited v. Mackinnon Mackenzie Employees Union MANU/SC/0188/2015 : (2015) 4 SCC 544 (paras 42 and 44), Babu Verghese and Ors. v. Bar Council of Kerala and Ors.

W.P. (C) No. 1041/2020
122. This petition seeks to challenge various approvals including award of tender dated 2.9.2019, EC dated 17.6.2020 and No Objection by CVC dated 30.4.2020. The prayer reads thus:
i. Issue a writ in the nature of order and/or direction(s) calling for the records of the various approvals/decisions granted/taken to redevelop Central Vista including the Parliament such as the tender awarded pursuant to the Notice dated 02.09.2019 NIT No. 04/CPM/RPZ/NIT/2019-20, Environmental Clearance dated 17.06.2020 in relation to the Parliament, the Central Vista Committee "No objection" dated 30.04.2020, and after reviewing the same to quash and set aside the said approvals/decisions.
123. The grounds adopted by the Petitioner herein are similar to those adopted by the Petitioners in W.P. (C) No. 853/2020 and W.P. (C) No. 638/2020 and we do not intend to dilate on the same for brevity.
CONSIDERATION
RULE OF LAW
124. After ruminating on the blistering and exquisite arguments of the learned Counsel for the parties, we find that the same are proffered on the hypothesis of governance by Rule of Law with specific emphasis on the high constitutional tenets and values of democratic polity, as adopted in India, and the principle of constitutionalism. All other grounds, relating to alleged violations of statutory and municipal laws, flow from the Petitioners' understanding of the aforesaid fundamental principles and thus, we begin our discussion by examining this fundamental premise so as to understand to what extent, if at all, and in what manner policy/administrative decision-making can be overseen in judicially manageable standards in the light of such principles.
125. To consider the matters in issue, we deem it apposite to traverse through some illuminating discourse of founding fathers of our country. On 9.12.1946, when the Constituent Assembly embarked upon the journey to create the most fundamental instrument of future governance of the country, it had two concepts in mind-democracy and Rule of Law. The reason for this pin-pointed emphasis reflects aptly from the words of Sir S. Radhakrishnan, who rose to speak up as the first speaker after election of Permanent Chairman on 11.12.1946. He said:
...We have to remember with gratitude all those great souls who worked and suffered for the freedom of this country, for the dawn of this day. Thousands died, more thousands suffered privation, imprisonment, and exile, and it is their suffering that has cemented and built up this great edifice...27
126. The fact that millions of Indians had struggled incessantly to breathe in a democratic polity which treated them not as mere subjects but as cardinal constituents on which the whole edifice of the nation stands, was the primary reason that our Constitution makers wanted an environment where law operates equally upon one and all, where Rule of Law trumps over even the slightest notion of Rule by whims, where the equation between state and citizens is not marked by imbalance and where law, as it exists, governs all legal relationships.
127. When an effort is made to decipher the understanding of members as regards the concept of governance by Rule of Law during the Constituent Assembly Debates, an interesting pattern emerges and we must delineate it henceforth. During the discussion on Part-III, Mr. Naziruddin Ahmad emphatically stated that democracy means Rule of law. He elaborated his viewpoint by stating thus:
We are erecting one of the finest democracies in the world. But the implication of democracy must be squarely faced. Democracy means a Rule of law as opposed to a Rule of force. In autocracies and in Totalitarian States the law is not supreme. But democracy means supremacy of the law where no one, be he the highest individual, is above the law. We should therefore all respect law and should be law-abiding citizens in order to inculcate that sense of law-abidingness wherein lies the safety of democracy. We should ourselves follow democratic principles, democratic methods and respect the law.28
(emphasis supplied)
On another occasion, Dr. P.K. Sen exposited that Rule of Law is meant to save the Government from disruptive tendencies. He said:
...The Rule of law is, in my humble judgment, the Rule that should save the Government from all manner of disruptive tendencies...28
While speaking on the administrative setup that the British left for us, Dr. P. Subbarayan observed Rule of Law to be a concept on which future of the country depends. He said:
The second point I wish to touch upon is the Rule of law which I think is a peculiar part of the English legal system. If there is anything which I would like to cling to in the future of this country, it is this Rule of law...29
On 17.9.1949, Mr. K.M. Munshi rose to speak on the evolution of Supreme Court of India for the independent India and expressed an earnest hope premised on nothing but the ideal of Rule of Law. He said:
Sir, the British Parliament and the Privy, Council are the two great institutions which the Anglo-Saxon race has given to mankind. The Privy Council during the last few centuries has not only laid down law, but coordinated the concept of rights and obligations throughout all the Dominions and Colonies in the British Commonwealth. So far as India is concerned, the role of the Privy Council has been one of the most important. It has been a very great unifying force and for us Indians it became the instrument and embodiment of the Rule of law, a concept on which alone we have based the democratic institutions which we have set up in our Constitution.30
(emphasis supplied)
He added:
Sir, on the 26th of January our Supreme Court will come into existence and it will join the family of Supreme Courts of the democratic world of which the Privy Council is the oldest and perhaps the greatest. I can only hope and trust that though we part with the Privy Council our Supreme Court will carry forward the traditions of the Privy Council, traditions which involve that judicial detachment, that unflinching integrity, that subordination of everything to the Rule of law and that conscientious regard for the rights and for justice not only between subjects and subjects but also between the State and the subjects.

What emerges from this discourse is that the makers of the Constitution envisaged a legal and political system which would be subservient to Rule of Law.
128. Rule of Law inter alia posits four universal tenets. It is a system of laws, institutions, norms and community commitment that envisages-Accountability of Government and private actors alike under the law; The laws must be just, clear, publicized and stable and applied evenly, protect fundamental rights and human rights; Open Government-meaning thereby the processes by which the laws are enacted, administered and enforced are accessible, fair and efficient; and Accessible justice-to include timely delivery of justice by competent, ethical, and independent representations and neutrals who are accessible, have adequate resources and mirror the traits of the communities they serve31.
129. Theoretically, the concept of Rule of Law was understood and applied to advance even autocratic regime. Louis XIV, Napolean and Hitler had Governments based on nothing but Rule of Law. But with the evolution of political discourse, the expanse of Rule of Law traversed from an autocratic to a democratic one. It underwent a transformation from being a concept used by autocrats to control their subjects to a living idea of governance wherein citizens and state interact with each other on a level playing field.
130. For the purposes of present examination, we need to provide life and meaning to this idea as a concept capable of judicial application with manageable standards and not just as an idea of political rhetoric. The difference between these two approaches is real and reflects in the introductory words of T.R.S. Allan in "Constitutional Justice" where he notes thus:
Its rhetorical power in aid of an argument about governmental authority, individual liberty, or constitutional legitimacy, makes the Rule of law an object of understandable suspicion as much as one of reverence: its uncertain and contested content allows it to be too readily invoked in support of opinions whose cogency might not withstand careful scrutiny...32

131. The principle of Rule of Law coalesces two words-rule and law. The two words are not only connected with each other but also control the meanings attributable to each other. "Rule" refers to the idea of governing the state and depending on the nature of model adopted in a country, such Rule can be effected in multiple ways. When we gave to ourselves the Constitution, we categorically envisioned such Rule to be "DEMOCRATIC" i.e., Government of the people, by the people and for the people. The word "law", now, lays down the precise contours of mode of ruling in India. Article 13 provides an inclusive definition of "law" as understood in India and reads thus:
13. Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights.--
(1) All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
(2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this Clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.
(3) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,--
(a) "law" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, Regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law;
(b) "laws in force" includes laws passed or made by a Legislature or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed, notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas.
(4) Nothing in this Article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made Under Article 368.
The first written safeguard, mentioned in Article 13, categorically prohibits the making of any law which contravenes the fundamental rights. The legislation passed in Parliament is not included in this definition but is covered separately in Articles 245 and 246. What is clear is that the structure of Rule in India is duly codified by the makers. It primarily means a democratic Rule based upon law as envisaged in the Constitution.
132. With passage of time, the word "law" has also been circumscribed by a plethora of safeguards, written and unwritten, thereby widening the array of rights which were not articulated by the founding fathers. For, the most remarkable features of a living and dynamic Constitution are its ability to grow and stay effective with the growth of socio-economic structures and vicissitudes. To elaborate further, the characteristics of reasonableness, non-arbitrariness and fairness have time and again shown direction to law and thus, to Rule by such law.
133. The above discussion is instructive on at least three counts-first, Rule of Law requires law in existence; second, such law must qualify as law within the meaning of the Constitution and must satisfy the standards laid therein and third, legally applicable meaning of Rule of Law in India can be best understood as a democratic Rule within the four corners of the Constitution, as originally envisaged and as is interpreted from time to time. The existence of democracy per se does not guarantee adherence to Rule of Law, but abidance of Rule of Law by one and all is the hallmark of a real thriving democracy.
134. The fact that all power flows from law and must be exercised in accordance with such law is easy to be theorized in a constitutional discourse, but difficult to be sustained in the aftermath of ever-expanding potpourri of the law itself. It is for this very reason the statement-'Rule of Law' must encompass a dynamic concept albeit rooted in four corners of the Constitution. It provides a constant trigger to any state-citizen intercourse and calls upon this Court to strike a just balance between two entities, both equally bound by the same principle of superiority of law. A just and time-tested methodology to strike this balance lies in the end product of furthering the avowed goal of a democracy premised upon Rule of Law and not dragging it backwards.
135. The principle of Rule of Law runs as a common thread through the substantive as well as procedural laws. A democratic polity requires all organs of the state to attach equal importance to substance of law as well as to the procedure delineated to perform such substantive functions. That must be the constant endeavour to touch both ends as well as means.
DEMOCRATIC DUE PROCESS AND JUDICIAL REVIEW
136. The Petitioners have called upon this Court to apply the scale of "democratic due process" for examining the validity of procedures adopted by the Respondents at various stages. Before expressing our opinion on whether the concept of Rule of Law in India envisions something akin to a democratic due process or not, we must make an endeavour to understand the meaning of this phrase.
137. The phrase "democratic due process" is not privy to any reasonably acceptable definition and thus, it is relevant to understand it in substance. Rodney A. Smolla, in his seminal work "Democratic Due Process: Administrative Procedure after Bishop v. Wood"33 explained this phrase in the form of a negative concept i.e., one that diminishes constitutional protections rather than enhancing them, as opposed to the Petitioners' understanding. He couched it as a phenomenon wherein:
... the responsibility for defining, shaping and limiting administrative due process has been taken from the courts and given to the legislatures. By placing this responsibility in the hands of elected representatives, the Supreme Court has in effect created a "democratic due process Clause.....
138. The background story leading upto the enunciation of this phrase can be understood by making a reference to Bishop v. Wood MANU/USSC/0078/1976 : 426 U.S. 341 (1976) wherein the US Supreme Court upheld the termination of Carl Bishop, a policeman in North Carolina, who was terminated without a prior hearing. The Court affirmed the decision on the ground that the applicable statutory employment laws did not mandate any prior hearing and the same could not be compelled by the invocation of the due process Clause. Upon further examination, one would note that this decision was not an isolated one, rather, it was a culmination of prior decisions on terminations from public employment, as noted by Smolla in his work. Beginning from Arnett, Director, Office of Economic Opportunity, Et. Al. v. Kennedy Et. Al. MANU/USSC/0182/1974 : 416 U.S. 134 (1974) and Board of Regents of State Colleges Et. Al. v. Roth 408 U.S. 564 (1972), the US Supreme Court made a conscious departure from the due process Clause, as enshrined in 14th amendment of the US Constitution. The basis of this departure is reflected in the opinion of Justice Stewart, writing for the Court in Roth 408 U.S. 564 (1972) wherein he observed that there are some processes in the Government wherein due process Clause may not be imported. He relied upon the language of fourteenth amendment which lays down that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law" to hold that due process Clause would become operative only when a person's life, liberty or property is at stake. The underlying idea behind shifting the judicial eye from blanket application of due process to enforcement of specific processes under statutes is that, due process must be restricted to matters involving actual deprivation of life, liberty or property. Smolla, in the aforesaid work, notes that all administrative due process decisions were primarily marked by two characteristics:
..... first, a property interest is not an abstract expectation of a benefit, but a legitimately claimed entitlement; and second, in determining whether an asserted interest is a mere expectation or a matured entitlement, the Court will look not to the Constitution, but to an independent source of law, such as a state statute34.
This conscious judicial departure from blanket application of due process Clause is understood in the American constitutional discourse as evolution of due process into democratic due process-as it restates giving effect to the mandate of statutes duly enacted by elected representatives.
139. Though the Petitioners have used this phrase in a manner which is purportedly opposite to the way democratic due process is perceived in U.S., the above discussion is relevant to understand the thrust of the Petitioners on acceptance of a procedural standard akin to "due process" in administrative matters. The above discussion irresistibly offers the following takeaways-
first, the requirement of due process is envisaged in matters involving deprivation of individual rights;
second, before asserting deprivation of a right, the claimant has to discharge the onus of proving the entitlement to such right;
third, such deprivation needs to be demonstrably proved in order to remedy it;
fourth, even in U.S., there is judicial acceptance of the tenet that the requirement of due process cannot be enforced in all Government processes;
fifth, there can be situations when existence of duly enacted and valid statutes may preclude the application of the principle of due process in adjudication.
140. Reverting to the Indian context, the inroad of due process Clause in the Indian Constitution has a unique history of its own. When Pandit Shri Thakur Das Bhargava, in the Constituent Assembly, proposed an amendment to Article 15 (now Article 21) to substitute the words "procedure established by law" with "due process of law35", he was supported by many other stalwarts of the Assembly who, in one voice, considered that inclusion of the later expression would be much more effective in safeguarding personal liberty of persons. The proposed change, however, did not appeal to others including Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Mr. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar. Drawing upon the origin and dubious acceptability of the doctrine in U.S., Ayyar said:
... Today, according to Professor Willis, the expression means, what the Supreme Court says what it means in any particular case. It is just possible, some ardent democrats may have a greater faith in the judiciary than in the conscious will expressed through the enactment of a popular legislature. Three gentlemen or five gentlemen, sitting as a court of law, and stating what exactly is due process according to them in any particular case, after listening to long discourses and arguments of briefed counsel on either side, may appeal to certain democrats more than the expressed wishes of the legislature or the action of an executive responsible to the legislature. In the development of the doctrine of `due process', the United States Supreme Court has not adopted a consistent view at all and the decisions are conflicting. One decision very often reversed another decision. I would challenge any member of the Bar with a deep knowledge of the cases in the United States Supreme Court to say that there is anything like uniformity in regard to the interpretation of `due process'. One has only to take the index in the Law Reports Annotated Edition for fifteen years and compare the decisions of one year with the decisions of another year and he will come to the conclusion that it has no definite import. It all depended upon the particular Judges that presided on the occasion. Justice Holmes took a view favourable to social control. There were other Judges of a Tory complexion who took a strong view in favour of individual liberty and private property...35
(emphasis supplied)
Before the amendment was negatived by voting, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar rose to sum up the controversy in the Assembly and noted as to how the distinction between "due process" and "procedure established by law" is essentially one of the extents and scope of judicial review that the Courts must be empowered to exercise in independent India. He said:
... The question now raised by the introduction of the phrase 'due process' is whether the judiciary should be given the additional power to question the laws made by the State on the ground that they violate certain fundamental principles.35
He went on to elaborate and, in a way, to reinforce the express negation of due process Clause which was to follow his speech and said:
The question of "due process" raises, in my judgment, the question of the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. In a federal constitution, it is always open to the judiciary to decide whether any particular law passed by the legislature is ultra vires or intra vires in reference to the powers of legislation which are granted by the Constitution to the particular legislature. If the law made by a particular legislature exceeds the authority of the power given to it by the Constitution, such law would be ultra vires and invalid. That is the normal thing that happens in all federal constitutions. Every law in a federal constitution, whether made by the Parliament at the Centre or made by the legislature of a State, is always subject to examination by the judiciary from the point of view of the authority of the legislature making the law. The 'due process' Clause, in my judgment, would give the judiciary the power to question the law made by the legislature on another ground. That ground would be whether that law is in keeping with certain fundamental principles relating to the rights of the individual...
(emphasis supplied)
The above discussion vividly expounds that the makers of the Constitution expressly rejected the incorporation of a due process Clause.
141. The express deletion of "due process" from the draft Constitution and replacement thereof by "procedure established by law" as noted by Jurist Granville Austin, is adverted to by this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (I) MANU/SC/1044/2017 : (2017) 10 SCC 1 thus:
276. The third major change which the Constituent Assembly made was that the phrase "due process of law" was deleted from the text of the draft Constitution. Following B.N. Rau's meeting with Justice Frankfurter, the Drafting Committee deleted the phrase "due process of law" and replaced it with "procedure established by law". Granville Austin refers to the interaction between Frankfurter and B.N. Rau and the reason for the deletion [Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation (Oxford University Press, 1966) at p. 103.]:
Soon after, Rau began his trip to the United States, Canada, Eire, and England to talk with justices, constitutionalists, and statesmen about the framing of the Constitution. In the United States he met Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who told him that he considered the power of judicial review implied in the due process Clause both undemocratic--because a few Judges could veto legislation enacted by the representatives of a nation--and burdensome to the Judiciary. Frankfurter had been strongly influenced by the Harvard Law School's great constitutional lawyer, James Bradley Thayer, who also feared that too great a reliance on due process as a protection against legislative oversight or misbehaviour might weaken the democratic process. Thayer's views had impressed Rau even before he met Frankfurter. In his Constitutional Precedents, Rau had pointed out that Thayer and others had 'drawn attention to the dangers of attempting to find in the Supreme Court--instead of in the lessons of experience--a safeguard against the mistakes of the representatives of people'.
142. Further, the whole idea of due process was meant to safeguard personal liberties of individuals by ensuring that the process to be used for taking away such liberty complies with certain standards. It was never meant to be used to circumscribe or to question the administrative decisions by applying higher bench mark than the statutory defined/articulated obligations. This is not to say that administrative action was left unchecked by the Constitution. The Constitution provides for a scheme wherein "law" is made subject to all the provisions of Part-III depending on the nature of action and nature of consequence on the rights. The test of nature of action and nature of consequence is essential to determine the nature of remedy that the Constitution can offer. For this purpose, a line must be drawn between executive action which has a direct bearing on personal liberty of individual; and executive action which comprises of ministerial/administrative functions with no direct impact on individual liberties.
143. The distinction is relevant to highlight a crucial aspect of the growth of constitutional law in India. As regards individual liberties, we have witnessed a wholehearted and rather expansive approach by the Court. One would note that it was during the review of an administrative action with bearing on personal liberty that this Court mandated the procedure in "procedure established by law" to be just, fair and non-arbitrary, as distinguished from fanciful, arbitrary and oppressive in Maneka Gandhi MANU/SC/0133/1978 : AIR 1978 SC 597. With unwinding of time, dimensions came to be added to increase the fairness of procedure so as to make it more exacting for the executive to put curbs on personal liberty of an individual. In Mithu v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0065/1983 : (1983) 2 SCC 277 and Sunil Batra MANU/SC/0184/1978 : (1978) 4 SCC 494, standards of fairness and non-arbitrariness were held to inform the word "law" as well in the phrase "procedure established by law" because individual liberties were at stake. In Sunil Batra MANU/SC/0184/1978 : (1978) 4 SCC 494, Desai J. noted in para 228 thus:
228.... The word "Law" in the expression "procedure established by law" in Article 21 has been interpreted to mean in Maneka Gandhi case that the law must be right, just and fair, and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. Otherwise it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would no be satisfied. If it is arbitrary it would be violative of Article 14...
However, in Rajbala and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/SC/1416/2015 : (2016) 2 SCC 445, this Court succinctly observed about the non-existence of the doctrine of substantive due process in the Indian Constitution thus:
64. From the above extract from McDowell & Co. case [State of A.P. v. McDowell & Co., MANU/SC/0427/1996 : (1996) 3 SCC 709, para 43] it is clear that courts in this country do not undertake the task of declaring a piece of legislation unconstitutional on the ground that the legislation is "arbitrary" since such an exercise implies a value judgment and courts do not examine the wisdom of legislative choices unless the legislation is otherwise violative of some specific provision of the Constitution. To undertake such an examination would amount to virtually importing the doctrine of "substantive due process" employed by the American Supreme Court at an earlier point of time while examining the constitutionality of Indian legislation. As pointed out in the above extract, even in United States the doctrine is currently of doubtful legitimacy. This Court long back in A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras MANU/SC/0035/1956 : AIR 1957 SC 297 declared that the doctrine of due process has no application under the Indian Constitution [Municipal Committee, Amritsar v. State of Punjab, MANU/SC/0050/1969 : (1969) 1 SCC 475]. As pointed out by Frankfurter, J., arbitrariness became a mantra.
