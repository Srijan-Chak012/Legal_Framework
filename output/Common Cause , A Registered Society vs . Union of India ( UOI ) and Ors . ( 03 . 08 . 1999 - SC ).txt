ORDER
Saiyed Saghir Ahmad, J.
1. This is a Review Petition in Whit Petition No. 26 of 1995 which was filed by Mr. H.D. Shourie for the following reliefs:
(i) Pass an appropriate writ, order or orders directing the Respondents 1 to 3 to specifically declare as to when the Union of India will now bring before the Parliament an appropriately drafted Bill for enactment of legislation for the establishment of the institution of Lokpal, or a suitable alternative system of the nature of Ombudsman which is operating in a number of other countries, for checking and controlling corruption in public offices, inter alia, at the political and bureaucratic levels, and whether in the enactment of such legislation they will take in to consideration the suggestions that have emanated from the Colloquium recently organised under the auspices of Indian Institute of Public Administration with the participation of foreign and Indian experts for examining various aspects of the matter relating to establishment of Ombudsman institution in this country;
(ii) Pass an appropriate writ, order or orders directing that the institutions and organisations of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Chief Vigilance Commissioner, and the Central Bureau of Investigation should indicate to the Hon'ble Court the specific steps which they will take for effectively overcoming any inadequacies and weaknesses in the operations of these important institutions which presently hamper effective and efficacious check on prevalence of corrupt practices in the country and to curb corruption at all political and bureaucratic levels;
(iii) Pass an appropriate writ, order or orders appointing a Commission or Commissioner to urgently undertake comprehensive study of the present inadequacies in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 for making specific recommendations to strengthen this enactment for achieving the objective of curbing and checking corruption at the political and bureaucratic levels in the country.
(iv) Pass an appropriate writ, order or orders directing the State Governments Respondents to indicate to the Hon'ble Court as to when they propose implementing the specific suggestions which have been made for strengthening and improvement of the functioning of the system of Lokayukta, including inter alia, the following:
a) To ensure expeditious establishment of the " institution of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta in every State;
b) To achieve uniformity in the provisions of various Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta Acts; and
c) To confer constitutional status on the institution of Lokayukta.
2. The petition was taken up by this Court on 10-2-1995 when the following order was passed:
After hearing Mr. Shourie, appearing in-per- son, we give him liberty to amend the petition by making broad base on the subject of curbing corruption in the country. To come up on 24-2-1995,
3. On 10-5-1995, the following order was passed:
We request the Supreme Court Legal Aid Society to depute a counsel to assist us in this case along with Mr. Shourie, Advocate. The Le-gal Aid Society shall also serve the unserved respondents by depositing the necessary process fee and other expenses. To be listed on 11th August, 1995. All affidavits and counter-affidavits may be tendered in the Registry.
4. On 11-8-1995, the Court passed the following order:
Mr. Shourie, the petitioner appearing in-per-son, states that it is of utmost importance to have a Lok Pal to curb corruption in the country. Mr. Gupta, learned Solicitor General states that efforts have been made more than once to have consensus regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed bill. According to him efforts are still being made. It is a matter which concerns the Parliament and the Court cannot do anything substantial in this matter. Short of that, learned Solicitor General states that he would apply his mind to the various aspects raised in this petition and make some useful suggestions. Mr. Muralidhar, appearing as amicus curiae to assist us, also states that he would examine the various reports submitted by Comptroller and Auditor General from time to time and in consultation with the Solicitor General and Mr. Shourie make some suggestions for the consideration of this Court.
Mr. Shourie has invited our attention to a news item in the front page of Indian Express of Friday August 11, 1995 under the caption "In Satish Sharma's reign, petrol and patronage flow together." It is not possible for us to take any action on the press report. On our suggestion the Solicitor General takes notice of this news item and states that he would have the matter examined in the Ministry concerned and shall file an affidavit of the Secretary concerned in the Ministry reacting to this news item. He may file the affidavit within the period of eight weeks.
The writ petition is adjourned to 13-10-1995.
5. The petition, thus, was diverted towards Captain Satish Sharma who was, at that time, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas in the Central Government. By judgment dated September 25, 1996 MANU/SC/0976/1996 : AIR1996SC3538 all the 15 petrol outlets, allotted by the Minister to various persons out of his discretionary quota, were cancelled and the following directions were issued to Captain Satish Sharma (petitioner):
Capt. Satish Sharma shall show cause within two weeks why a direction be not issued to the appropriate police authority to register a case and initiate prosecution against him for criminal breach of trust or any other offence under law. He shall further show cause within the said period why he should not, in addition, be made liable to pay damages for his mala fide action in allotting petrol pumps to the above mentioned fifteen persons.
6. The petitioner submitted the reply to the show cause notice which was disposed of by judgment dated November 4, 1996 MANU/SC/1287/1996 : (1996)6SCC593 . The following operative order was passed (Paras 15 and 16 of AIR):
We are of the view that the legal position that exemplary damages can be awarded in a case where the action of a public servant is oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional is unexceptionable. The question for consideration, however, is whether the action of Capt. Satish Sharma makes him liable to pay exemplary damages. In view of the findings of this Court in common cause case - quoted above - the answer has to be in the affirmative. Satish Sharma's actions were wholly arbitrary, mala fide and unconstitutional. This Court has given clear findings to this effect in the Common Cause case. We, therefore, hold that Capt. Satish Sharma is liable to pay exemplary damages.
We have heard Mr. H.N. Salve on the question of quantum. Mr. Salve has vehemently contended that Capt. Sharma was a part of the system which was operating before his joining as a Minister. According to him the types of wrongs were being committed even earlier on the assumption that the Minister's discretion was to be exercised on his subjective satisfaction. He has further contended that since the concept of absolute liability of public servants for misfeasance has been of recent origin in this country even while awarding exemplary damages leniency should be shown. There is some plausibility in the contentions raised by Mr. Salve. After examining all the facts and circumstances of this case and giving thoughtful consideration to this aspect. We direct Capt. Satish Sharma to pay a sum of Rs. 50 lacs as exemplary damages to the Government exchequer. Since the property with which Capt. Sharma was dealing was public property, the Government which is "by the people" has to be compensated. We further direct Capt. Sharma to deposit the amount with the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Government of India within nine months from today. The amount if not paid, shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue.
7. The present review petition relates to these two judgments.
8. The revision petition was put up before the Bench comprising of Hon'ble Bharucha and Faizan Uddin, JJ. on 28-1-1997 when the Court directed "Issue notice on the Review Petition."
9. On notice being served on Mr. H.D. Shourie, he filed his reply to the Review Petition on 21-2-1997.
10. The office report dated 30th June, 1997 is to be following effect:
In the matter abovementioned, this Court on 28th January, 1997 directed to issue notice of the Review Petition.
Accordingly, notice was issued to both the respondents and hence the service of notice is complete as both the respondents are represented by Mr. H.D. Shourie, respondent in-person and Ms. Anil Katiyar, Advocate for respondent No. 2.
Mr. Ashok K. Mahajan, Advocate has filed application for impleadment on behalf of Mr. Arun K. Gupta resident of Kothi No. 68, Sector VIIIA, Chandigarh and also seeking stay of further investigation by CBI during pendency of Review Petition. Since the said application was not served on other side, a letter dated 4th March, 1997 and another letter dated 30th June, 1997 was issued to Mr. Ashok K. Mahajan to serve it on Mr. H.D. Shourie, respondent No. 1 and Ms. Anil Katiyar representing respondent No. 2 and Mr. P.H. Parekh, Advocate. He was also requested to furnish proof of service but he has not furnished the same so far.
Further, Mrs. Sandhya Goswami, Advocate has also filed four separate applications for impleadment on behalf of M/s. Shiv Balak Pasi, Syed Hassan Saukat Abidi, Dharmesh Kumar and Pradeep Kumar without serving its copies on the other sides. She was asked to serve the same on all the parties and furnish proof of service but the same has not been furnished by her so far. All the applications for impleadment as party are being circulated to Hon'ble Judges with this office report.
It is further submitted that Mrs. Anil Katiyar, Advocate has filed an application for clarification and modification of order dated 25th September, 1996 which has been registered as LA. No. 6. Further she has also filed counter-affidavit on behalf of Union of India deposed by Director, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India. The said application and counter-affidavit are being circulated with this office report for orders.
11. Thereafter, the matter came up before the Bench comprising of Hon'ble S.C. Sen and Sujata Manohar, JJ. on 8-7-1997. Mr. H.D. Shourie, who had filed the Writ Petition (C) No. 26 of 1995, was present in-person, but the case was adjourned to 25th of July, 1997. On 25-7-1997, the case was shown in the cause list, but the following notice was also published in that cause list:
TAKE NOTICE THAT the above mentioned matters listed in Court No. 8 before a Special Bench of Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.C. Sen and Hon'ble Mrs. Justice Sujata V. Manohar, as Item Nos. "C" and "D" in the Daily List for 25th July, 1997 issued on 19th July, 1997 will not be taken up for hearing and the same stand adjourned to 22nd August, 1997.
BY ORDER
DATED this the 25th day of July, 1997.
12. The case was thus adjourned to 22-8-1997 and on that date the Bench comprising of Hon'ble S. C. Sen and Sujata Manohar, JJ., adjourned the case to 9-9-1997. Mr. K. Parasaran, Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, was directed to give his written arguments. On 1-9-1997, Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, Senior Counsel, was appointed as amicus curiae. When the case came up before the Bench of Hon'ble S. C. Sen and Sujata Manohar, JJ., their Lordships released the case with the further direction that it would not be treated as part-heard with them. On 27-3-1998, the case came up before the Bench of Hon'ble S.C. Agrawal and Sujata Manohar, JJ. when the following order was passed:
Since the argument on this petition is likely to take some time it is directed that the matter may be listed on a non-miscellaneous day. The Registrar Judicial will take appropriate directions from Hon'ble the Chief Justice for listing the matter before an appropriate Bench.
13. It was thereafter that the matter was placed before this Bench. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also heard Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, Senior Counsel, (Amicus Curiae).
14. Mr. K. Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel for the applicant, has contended that since the applicant was Minister of State for Petroleum in the Central Government and it was in his capacity as an essential component of the Central Government, that he had made allotment of Petrol Pumps out of his discretionary quota, his act in making the allotments shall be treated to be the act of the Central Government with the result that even if such allotments were cancelled on the ground of arbitrary exercise of power, the Court could not have legally directed exemplary damages to be paid by the Government to itself. He also contended that the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 was limited, unlike the vast jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution and, therefore, in exercise of the limited jurisdiction, the Court cannot award exemplary damages for the "tort of misfeasance in office," as in the proceedings under this article, which constitute Public Law proceedings, damages can be awarded only for the violation of the Fundamental Rights of citizens either by the Government or its officers, specially the Right to Life, but not for "Tort" for which action should have been initiated under the Private Law by filing a suit in a Court of competent jurisdiction.
15. Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner being a Minister of State in the Union Cabinet was a part of the Government and his act being the act of the President, as the petitioner was in the Central Cabinet, the same could not be made the basis of action for damages under the Law of Torts and therefore, under Public Law as well, the petitioner could not be held liable for damages or, for that matter, exemplary damages.
16. Relying upon the decision of this Court in Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0073/1974 : (1974)IILLJ465SC , which specifically dealt with the business rules of the Union Cabinet and laid down that the act of a Minister would be treated as the act of the President or the Governor, as the case may be, learned counsel for the petitioner contended that if the petitioner, in exercise of his discretionary power, had allocated or allotted petroleum outlets to needy persons, he would be treated to have acted only on behalf of the President and his act could not be questioned in any Court, including this Court, nor could the act of allotment of petrol outlets to various persons, constitute a basis for damages. The contention further is that the petitioner having acted as Minister of State, his act would be treated to be the act of the entire Cabinet which, on the principle of 'collective responsibility,' would be treated to have endorsed the act of the petitioner in making the allotments of Petrol outlets and since the Cabinet is answerable to the Parliament, where the allotments were not questioned, the same cannot be questioned here in this Court.
17. We have seriously considered the contention of Mr. Parasaran, as set out above, but we are unable to agree with him on the broad proposition placed before us.
18. The Executive power of the Union is vested in the President under Article 53 of the Constitution. The extent of the Executive power is indicated in Article 73. The next article, namely, Article 74 provides for a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President. Article 75(3) speaks of the collective responsibility of the Cabinet which provides that the Cabinet shall be responsible to Parliament. Article 77 provides for the conduct of business of the Government of India and Clause (3) thereof empowers the President to make rules for the convenient transaction of its business and for allocation amongst Ministers of the said business. It is in exercise of this power that rules for allocation of business have been framed under which various divisions of work to different Ministries have been indicated. Distribution of petroleum products, including petroleum outlets, is also one of the subjects which has been allocated to the Ministry of Petroleum.
19. The functions of the Govt. are carried out in the name of the President by Ministers appointed by him on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Executive consists of :
(a) Prime Minister and Ministers who are members of the Cabinet;
(b) Ministers who are not of Cabinet rank;
(c) The Civil Service.
20. Since the functions of the Govt. are carried on by the Executive in the name of the President on the advice of Ministers, they (Ministers) alone are answerable to the Parliament. The Civil Service as such has no constitutional personality or responsibility separate from the duly constituted Govt.
21. Article 77(1) and (2) provide that what ever executive action is taken by the Government of India, the same shall be expressed to have been taken in the name of the President.
22. Executive power is not defined in the Constitution. Article 73 relating to the Union of India and Article 163 relating to the State deal primarily with the extent of executive power. In Rai Sahib Ram Jaw ay a Kapur v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0011/1955 : [1955]2SCR225 , the then Chief Justice Mukherje a pointed out (Para 12 of AIR):
It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function means and implies. Ordinarily the executive power connotes the residue of Governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away.
23. This judgment also deals with the concept of Cabinet, the Council of Ministers, its collective responsibility and how the Executive functions subject to the control of the Legislature. It is laid down that although the President is the head of the executive, he acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, who are all members of the Legislature and since the President has to act upon the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Legislature indirectly controls the functioning of the Executive. The relevant portions are extracted below:
Our Constitution, though federal in its structure, is modelled on the British Parliamentary system where the executive is deemed to have the primary responsibility for the formulation of governmental policy and its transmission into law though the condition precedent to the exercise of this responsibility is its retaining the confidence of the legislative branch of the State...
...In India, as in England, the executive has to act subject to the control of the legislature; but in what way is this control exercised by the Legislature? Under Article 53(1)..., the executive power of the Union is vested in the President but under Article 75 there is to be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions. The President has thus been made a formal or constitutional head of the executive and the real executive powers are vested in the Ministers or the Cabinet. The same provisions obtain in regard to the Govt. of States; the Governor... occupies the position of the head of the executive in the State but it is virtually the Council of Ministers in each State that carries on the executive Govt. In the Indian Constitution, therefore, we have the same system of parliamentary executive as in England and the Council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of the members of the legislature is, like the British Cabinet, 'a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part.' The Cabinet enjoying, as it does, a majority in the legislature concentrates in itself the virtual control of both legislative and executive functions; and as the Ministers constituting the Cabinet are presumably agreed on fundamentals and act on the principle of collective responsibility, the most important questions of policy are all formulated by them.
24. This decision was referred to in State of M.P. v. Thakur Bharat Singh MANU/SC/0043/1967 : [1967]2SCR454 , wherein it was held that if the executive action of the Government affected prejudicially the rights of any citizen, such action would be justified only if it was supported by the authority of law. The concept and the extent of executive action was also examined by this Court in Naraindas Indurkhya v. State of M.P. MANU/SC/0066/1974 : [1974]3SCR624 , in which the decision in Rai Saheb Ram Jawaya Kapur's case MANU/SC/0011/1955 : [1955]2SCR225 (supra) was followed and it was laid down that the State Government could prescribe textbooks in the exercise of its executive power so long as it did not infringe the rights of anyone. This decision was reiterated in Jayantilal Amratlal Shodhan v. F.N. Rana MANU/SC/0046/1963 : [1964]5SCR294 and again in Bishambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/0056/1981 : [1982]1SCR1137 . The whole constitutional position was reconsidered by a seven-Judge Bench of this Court in Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0073/1974 : (1974)IILLJ465SC , in which the decision in B. K. Sardari Lal v. Union of India MANU/SC/0656/1971 : (1971)ILLJ315SC was specifically overruled and it was held that under Article 74(1), it is the function of the Council of Ministers to advise the President over the whole of the Central field and nothing is excepted from that field by this article. It was also pointed out that the Constitution of India has adopted the parliamentary or the Cabinet form of Government on the British model. The principle of English Constitutional Law that the King does not act on his own, but on the advice of Council of Ministers is embodied in the Indian Constitution as may be evident from the following words of justice Krishna Iyer in that case MANU/SC/0073/1974 : (1974)IILLJ465SC :
Not the Potomac, but the Thames, fertilises the flow of the Yamuna, if we may adopt a riverine imagery. In this thesis, we are fortified by precedents of this Court, strengthened by Constituent Assembly proceedings and reinforced by the actual working of the organs involved for about a 'silver jubilee' span of time.
25. It Was also pointed out in this case that the words "business of the Government of India" and "the business of the Government of the State," as used in Articles 77(3) and 166(3), include "all executive business." Seervai in his treatise "Constitutional Law of India," Silver Jubilee Edition, Fourth Edition, on page 2037 has, after a critical analysis of the judgment, extracted the following principles on the "business of the Government of India and allocation of business among Ministers":
(i) The expressions "business of the Government of India" and "the business of the Government of the State" in Articles 77(3) and 166(3) includes "all executive business."
(j) "Where the Constitution required the satisfaction of the President or the Governor for the exercise of any power or function by the President or the Governor as the case may be... the satisfaction required by the Constitution is not the personal satisfaction of the President or the Governor but is the satisfaction of the President or of the Governor in the constitutional sense under the Cabinet system of Government.... It is the satisfaction of the Council of Ministers on whose aid and advice the President or the Governor generally exercises all his powers and functions...." Articles 77(3) and 166(3) provide that the President or the Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of Government and the allocation of functions among Ministers. Rules of business and the allocation of functions to Ministers indicate that the satisfaction of the Minister or the officer is the satisfaction of the President or the Governor.
(k) Rules of business and allocation of business among Ministers are relatable to Articles 53 and 154 which provide that executive power cannot be exercised by the President and by the Governor either directly or through subordinate officers. The provisions made in Articles 74 and 163 for a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President and the Governor "are sources of the Business."
(l) Where the functions entrusted to a Minister are performed by an officer employed in the Minister's department, there is in law no delegation to that officer because the act or decision of the officer is that of the Minister: Halsbury, Vol. 1, 4th ed. para 748.
26. In view of the discussion held above, it will be seen that though an order is issued in the name of the President, it does not become an order of the President passed by him personally, but remains, basically and essentially, the order of the Minister on whose advice the President had acted and passed that order. Moreover, as required by Article 77(1), all executive actions of the Govt. of India have to be expressed in the name of the President; but this would not make that order an order passed by the President personally. That being so, the order carries with it no immunity. Being essentially an order of the Govt. of India, passed in exercise of its executive functions, it would be amenable to judicial scrutiny and, therefore, can constitute a valid basis for exercise of power of judicial review by this Court. The authenticity, validity and correctness of such an order can be examined by this Court in spite of the order having been expressed in the name of the President. The immunity available to the President under Article 361 of the Constitution cannot be extended to the orders passed in the name of the President under Article 77(1) or Article 77(2) of the Constitution.
27. The related question as to the liability of the Minister to pay damages to the Govt. will be considered by us while dealing with the "Tort of Misfeasance in Public Office" and payment of exemplary damages to the Govt.
28. The other aspect of the matter as argued by Mr. K. Parasaran as to the "collective responsibility" of the Cabinet with regard to the allotment of petrol outlets made by the petitioner in exercise of his discretionary quota may now be considered. It is contended by Mr. K. Parasaran that under the scheme of the Constitution, any order passed by the Minister shall be treated to be an order passed by the Cabinet which is collectively answerable to the House of the People under Article 75(3). It is contended that an order passed by the Minister individually in favour of various persons to whom petrol outlets were allotted cannot be questioned as it was not raised before the House of the People to whom the Cabinet, as a whole, was answerable. The whole series of allotments made by the petitioner could then have been debated before the House and since this was not done, it is not open to question those allotments in this Court by a writ petition and the proceedings were meant only to embarrass and harass the Cabinet. It is also contended that the petitioner had the jurisdiction to make allotments of petrol outlets and the discretionary quota allowed to him was utilised for that purpose. Since it is not the case that the jurisdiction was, in any way, exceeded or that allotments were made in excess of the quota or for monetary consideration, the same need not have been scrutinised by this Court nor could such allotments be made the basis for awarding exemplary damages or investigation by C.B.I.
29. Let us examine the viability of these submissions.
Our Constitution provides for a Parliamentary form of Govt. Article 79 provides that there shall be a Parliament for the Union which shall "consist of the President and two Houses known respectively as Council of States and the House of the People. Article 80 provides for the composition of the Council of States while Article 81 provides for the composition of the House of the People. Article 81 further provides that the House of the People shall consist of : (a) not more than 530 members chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the States; and (b) not more than 20 members to represent the Union Territories chosen in such manner as Parliament may by law provide. Article 83 provides for the duration of Houses of Parliament while Article 85 provides for the Sessions of Parliament, prorogation of the Houses or either House and dissolution of the House of the People. Article 86 speaks of the right of the President to address and send messages to Houses while Article 87 provides for Special Address by the President after each General Election to the House of the People and at the commencement of the first session of each year. Once the election to the House of the People is complete, comes the stage for the appointment of Prime Minister and Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President as provided by Article 74. Since the elections are contested principally by the political parties who set up their candidates at the election, there is tacit understanding in keeping with the British convention, that the party which has secured the majority in the House of the People would govern while the parties which are in the minority would sit in the Parliament as members of the "Opposition It is on account of this convention that the President invites the leader of the political party which has obtained majority, to form the Govt. The President appoints the Prime Minister and then the Ministers are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, who constitute the Council of Ministers. Article 75(3) provides that the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People.
30. The concept of "collective responsibility" is essentially a political concept. The country is governed by the party in power on the basis of the policies adopted and laid down by it in the Cabinet Meeting. "Collecting Responsibility" has two meanings : The first meaning which can legitimately be ascribed to it is that all members of a Govt. are unanimous in support of its policies and would exhibit that unanimity on public occasions although while formulating the policies, they might have expressed a different view in the meeting of the Cabinet. The other meaning is that Ministers, who had an opportunity to speak for or against the policies in the Cabinet are thereby personally and morally responsible for its success and failure.
31. In the British Constitution and Policies 5th Edition by J. Harvey and L. Bather, it is said as under:
Except when a Minister explains the reasons for his resignation, Parliament hears nothing of the Cabinet's current deliberations. These remain secret, and only decisions as a whole are reported to the House when policy is announced. Any leakage of divergent views held by Ministers would, as during Queen Victoria's region, seriously weaken the Government. In its decisions, 'the Cabinet is a unity to the House.' While a Minister can speak against any proposal in a Cabinet meeting, he must either support the policy decided upon or resign. Recent resignations of this nature are Frank Cousins (Prices and Incomes Bill, 1966) and Lord Longford (education cuts, 1968). But such resignations are infrequent. Ministers come from the same party and, at least initially, are fairly homogeneous in their political views. In any case, a former Minister is unlikely to cross the floor of the House and join the Opposition. His disagreement with the Government is usually over only one issue, and his basic political outlook remains unchanged.
Thus the Cabinet stands or falls together. Where the policy of a particular Minister is under attack, it is the Government as whole which is being attacked. Thus the defeat of a Minister on any major issue represents a defeat for the Government. However, today, unlike the nineteenth century, such defeats do not occur. The use of rigid party discipline ensures that the Government can always obtain a majority vote. Nevertheless, criticism may be so severe and widespread that the Government may modify its policy. If the, Minister identified with it feels that his prestige with the party has been badly damaged, he may resign, e.g. Sir Samuel Hoare (1935) over the proposals to partition Abyssinia.
In practice, therefore, all that collective responsibility means today is that every member of the Government must be prepared to support all Cabinet decisions both inside and outside the House.
It is further provided as under:
The doctrine of collective responsibility has practical advantages. First, it counteracts departmental separation for each Minister has to be concerned with policies of other departments. Second, it prevents the policy of one department being determined unilaterally. Since it is the Cabinet as a whole which decides Ministers are less likely to be over-influenced by their civil servants. Third, it ensures that Cabinet decisions are based on principles and not on personalities.
Collective responsibility does not apply to a Minister's responsibility for his permanent officials or for his personal mistakes.
32. In this connection, an extract from "The British Cabinet" by John P. Mackintosh, 1962 Edn., is set out below as it is also extremely relevant for this case.
Much has been said and written about the responsibility of Ministers. The discussion can easily become confused because of the different meanings that are attached to the word "responsible." Collective responsibility will be discussed below, and the first task is to consider whether there is any separate element of individual responsibility. The most common political meaning is that a certain Minister will answer parliamentary questions on a given subject. A second sense arises when those in political circles appreciate that a particular policy is largely the idea of the Minister, rather than the traditional policy of the party in power, and they may single out the Minister for attack. For instance, in 1903-05 Wyndham was pursuing his land purchase schemes for Ireland in a manner which alarmed many Conservatives and would certainly have been unlikely under any other Chief Secretary, A third sense is simply that a Minister is responsible even if a policy is the work of the Cabinet as a whole but his colleagues choose to place the burden upon him. Thus Sir Samuel Hoare thought he was acting in accordance with the views of the ministry in concluding the Hoare-Lavel Pact and his decisions were subsequently endorsed by the Cabinet till opposition became acute. He was then asked to disavow and denounce his actions but preferred, "accepting his responsibility," to resign. There is, in addition, the normal moral sense of the word meaning "culpable" and a Minister may, like a private individual, feel responsible if he could by greater wisdom or exertion have prevented some unfortunate occurrence.
The one aspect that remains is the alleged obligation on a Minister to resign when he or one of his subordinates has blundered. The origin of this notion is fairly clear. It dates from the 1850s and 1860s when it was reasonable to assume that a Minister could watch over every significant action of his department. Even then, there would have been no need to acknowledge errors in this way but for the power of the House of Commons to move and carry a motion censuring the individual in question without necessarily dislodging the Government.
33. From the above, it will be seen that in spite of the fact that the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the House of the People, there may be an occasion where the conduct of a Minister may be censured if he or his subordinates have blundered and have acted contrary to law.
34. No doubt it was open to the House of the People (Lok Sabha) to take up the issue of the abuse of discretionary quota by the petitioner in his capacity as the Minister of State for Petroleum, and his conduct could have been debated and scrutinised on the floor of the House, but the mere fact that this was not done would not mean that the allotments of petroleum outlets by him were immune from judicial scrutiny by this Court 1999 S.C./188 XIG-8 under Article 32 of the Constitution. Therefore, even if the matter was not raised on the floor of the Lok Sabha, it would be amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution.
35. Even in England, all Ministers and servants of the Crown are accountable to the Courts for the legality of their actions, and may be held civilly and criminally liable, in their individual capacities, for tortious or criminal acts. This liability may be enforced either by means of ordinary criminal or civil proceedings or by means of impeachment, a remedy which is probably obsolete. They are also subject to the judicial review jurisdiction of the Courts. (See : Halsbury's Laws of England -- Fourth Edition (Re-issue), Volume 8(2), Para 422).
36. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that neither could the Court award exemplary damages against the petitioner nor could it order any C.B.I. investigation as the petitioner in making the allotment of petrol outlets had not committed any offence, much less an offence of breach of trust. It is also contended that the petitioner while making allotments out of his discretionary quota available to him as Minister of State for Petroleum, had not committed the tort of misfeasance in public office and, therefore, he was not liable to pay any damages. Mr. K. Parasaran also argued that exemplary damages under law can be awarded in addition to the damages for the "tort" alleged to have been committed but where not even damages have been awarded, there is no question of awarding exemplary damages. It is also contended that action for tort could have been initiated only in the field of private law by instituting a suit in a proper Civil Court and not under the public law, namely, in proceedings initiated under Article 32 of the Constitution particularly as intricate questions of fact were involved.
37. Since the question whether the action could have been initiated under the public law and whether exemplary damages could have been awarded in those proceedings relates to the question of jurisdiction, we would take up this question first.
38. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court has been given the power and jurisdiction to issue appropriate writs in the nature of Mandamus, Certiorari, Prohibition, quo-warranto and Habeas Corpus for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights or for any other purpose. Thus, the High Court has jurisdiction not only to grant relief for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights but also for "any other purpose" which would include the enforcement of public duties by public bodies. So also, the Supreme Court under Article 32 has the jurisdiction to issue prerogative writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed to a citizen under the Constitution.
39. Essentially, under public law, it is the dispute between the citizen or a group of citizens on the one hand and the State or other public bodies on the other, which is resolved. This is done to maintain the rule of law and to prevent the State or the public bodies from acting in an arbitrary manner or in violation of that rule. The exercise of constitutional powers by the High Court and the Supreme Court under Articles 226 and 32 has been categorised as power of "judicial review." Every executive or administrative action of the State or other statutory or public bodies is open to judicial scrutiny and the High Court or the Supreme Court can, in exercise of the power of judicial review under the Constitution, quash the executive action or decision which is contrary to law or is violative of Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. With the expanding horizon of Article 14 read with other articles dealing with Fundamental Rights, every executive action of the Govt. or other public bodies, including instrumentalities of the Govt., or those which can be legally treated as "Authority" within the meaning of Article 12, if arbitrary, unreasonable or contrary to law, is now amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 or the High Courts under Article 226 and can be validly scrutinised on the touchstone of the constitutional mandates.
