3.

4.

Further, to give directions to open the culverts, closed channels of water and to ensure removal of debris on the subject site at the cost of the Appellants i.e. contemnors Nos. 1 to 10.
5. As all the aforesaid three applications have been filed alleging violation of the same orders, the applications were heard together and all being disposed of by the common order.
FACTS:
6. The Bombay High Court while disposing of the Writ Petition filed by the Action Group vide order dated 6.10.2005 issued several directions including:
XI. From the list of "Mangrove Areas" so identified Government owned lands will automatically be declared/notified as "Protected Forest". Likewise, privately owned lands from the list of Mangrove Areas so identified, the same will be declared/notified as "Forest".
7. In pursuance of the aforesaid direction issued by the High Court, the Divisional Commissioner, issued Notification being No. RB/Desk-II/Forest/CR-2211/Pvt./A-1 dated 18.2.2009, which included the land of the Appellants Krishnadevi Malchand Kamathia and Ors. In view of the said Notification, the Appellants could not restart the salt manufacturing, though the Appellants had been manufacturing salt on the said land since 1959. It continued upto 1990 and their license for manufacturing salt was valid upto 1993. The Coastal Area Classification and Development Regulations, 1991 (hereinafter called CRZ Regulations) came which provide for classification of coastal regulatory zone, according to which it did not prohibit the manufacturing of salt.
8. Being aggrieved, Appellants filed Special Leave Petition along with an application for condonation of delay of 1368 days challenging the Bombay High Court judgment and order dated 6.10.2005. However, in view of the fact that the Appellants had not been heard by the High Court at the time of passing the order in pursuance of which the Notification has been issued, the delay was condoned and the petition was entertained.
9. An application was filed by the Appellants on 15.12.2009 seeking permission to repair the damaged bund along with the land in issue. The application was opposed by the Respondents. However, this Court disposed of the said application vide order dated 5.2.2010 permitting the Appellants to approach the District Collector for the said relief. It was clarified that pendency of the proceedings before this Court or any interim order passed therein would not stand in the way of the District Collector to pass an appropriate order so far as the repair of the bund was concerned.
10. In pursuance of the said directions the Appellants approached the District Collector, who after holding inquiry passed a speaking and reasoned order dated 27.1.2010 giving full details and the case history of the dispute over the title of the land between the Appellants and the Government, and the application of the provisions of Coastal Regulatory Zone Regulations 1991; and the Indian Forest Act 1927; and Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. According to the order, the Appellants would repair the bund without destroying the mangroves or vegetation on the said land.
11. This Court disposed of the appeal vide order dated 7.5.2010 wherein the parties were given liberty to agitate the issue before the High Court raising all factual and legal issues. So far as the repair of Bund was concerned, this Court directed as under:
By an interim order passed by this Court on 22.3.2010, permitted the Petitioners to repair the Bund. This interim order is made absolute and Petitioners are permitted to maintain and upkeep the Bund till final adjudication regarding Notifications dated 18.2.2009 and 15.6.2009 is made and violation of these orders by parties or other authorities could be brought to the notice of this Court for appropriate directions.
12. The contempt petitions have been filed by the District Collector and the Action Group making allegations that under the garb of repairing the bund, the Appellants have raised the height and expanded the width of the bund in such a manner that mangrove would die a natural death without any attempt on the part of the Appellants, and further that Appellants have destroyed the mangroves to the great extent. Appellants filed a Contempt Petition alleging that Collector's order dated 27.1.2010 is being unnecessarily interfered with by the statutory authorities.
13. We have heard Shri Ram Jethmalani, Shri Sekhar Naphade, Shri Dushyant Dave, Shri Atul Yashwant Chitale, learned senior counsel appearing for the parties and perused the record.
14. It may be pertinent to mention here that all the learned Counsel appearing for the parties have suggested that the applications be heard without giving strict adherence to the procedure for contempt proceedings i.e. framing of charges etc., as pleadings are complete and parties are fully aware as what is the case against which of the parties. More so, all the documentary evidence, required to decide the case is on record.
15. Shri Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellants, submitted that in pursuance of the order of this Court dated 7.5.2010, the Appellants have instituted a civil suit before the Bombay High Court, wherein notices had been issued to the Respondents/Defendants and which is still pending consideration of all factual and legal issues had been raised therein. The validity of the Notification dated 18.2.2009 is also under challenge therein to the extent that the said Notification is void ab initio for the reason that the procedure prescribed in law has not been followed. More so, the Notification does not disclose what are the statutory provisions which conferred the power/competence to issue the said Notification.
16. Shri Sekhar Naphade, and Shri Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel, submitted that undoubtedly, the Notification does not disclose the source of power/competence under which it has been issued, however, the Notification does not become invalid merely for want of such a statement. Further, it cannot be urged that the Authority was denude of power to issue such notification as such powers are available under Section 21 of the Maharashtra Private Forest (Acquisition) Act, 1975. The said provisions provide that whenever it appears to the State Government that any tract of land not being the property of Government, contains trees and shrubs, pasture lands and any other land whatsoever, and that it should be declared, in public interest and for furtherance of the objects of the said Act, to be a private forest. The State Government would publish a Notification in the Official Gazette to declare that it was a forest land after following the procedure prescribed therein. In fact records of the Statutory Authority reveal that the said Notification has been published in view of the order passed by this Court on 12.12.1996 in T.N. Godavarman, wherein it has been held that Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, would apply to lands being forests, irrespective of who owned the land. For that purpose, Shri Naphade, has drawn our attention to para 4.2 of the Report of the Committee, dated 19.5.2010 (Annexure R-5A) to I.A. No. 23 of 2010.
17. It is settled legal proposition that even if an order is void, it requires to be so declared by a competent forum and it is not permissible for any person to ignore the same merely because in his opinion the order is void.
18. In State of Kerala v. M.K. Kunhikannan Nambiar Manjeri Manikoth Naduvil (dead) and Ors. MANU/SC/0240/1996 : AIR 1996 SC 906; Tayabbhai M. Bagasarwalla and Anr. v. Hind Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. etc. MANU/SC/0280/1997 : AIR 1997 SC 1240; M. Meenakshi and Ors. v. Metadin Agarwal (dead) by L.Rs. and Ors. MANU/SC/8453/2006 : (2006) 7 SCC 470; and Sneh Gupta v. Devi Sarup and Ors. MANU/SC/0238/2009 : (2009) 6 SCC 194, this Court held that whether an order is valid or void, cannot be determined by the parties. For setting aside such an order, even if void, the party has to approach the appropriate forum.
19. In State of Punjab and Ors. v. Gurdev Singh, Ashok Kumar AIR 1991 SC 2219, this Court held that a party aggrieved by the invalidity of an order has to approach the court for relief of declaration that the order against him is inoperative and therefore, not binding upon him. While deciding the said case, this Court placed reliance upon the judgment in Smith v. East Ellore Rural District Council (1956) 1 All ER 855 wherein Lord Radcliffe observed:
