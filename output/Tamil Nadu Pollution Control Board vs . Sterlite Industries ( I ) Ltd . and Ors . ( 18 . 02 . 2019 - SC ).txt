Case Note:
Environment - Maintainability of appeal - Section 16(a) of National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 - Present appeals arose out of orders that had been passed by National Green Tribunal ["NGT"] submitting that, appeal before NGT was not maintainable and hence, order was without jurisdiction - Whether NGT's order was clearly outside its statutory powers conferred by the Water Act, the Air Act, and the NGT Act.

Facts:

The Respondent, Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd./Vedanta Ltd., was operating a copper smelter plant at the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd. (SIPCOT). Respondent received a No-Objection Certificate ["NOC"] from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board ["TNPCB"] for the production of blister copper and sulphuric acid. The TNPCB granted its consent under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 ["Air Act"] and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 ["Water Act"] on 22.05.1995. After obtaining the requisite permissions, the consent to operate the plant was issued by the TNPCB. Production commenced. The residents of nearby areas started complaining of irritation, throat infection, severe cough, breathing problem, nausea etc. due to emissions from Sterlite Industries. Reports were obtained after inspection of the premises by the TNPCB. Based on these reports, the TNPCB issued a show-cause notice and directed closure of the unit under Section 31A of the Air Act on 29.03.2013. This order was stayed by the NGT on 31.05.2013, allowing the Respondent to commence production subject to certain conditions. Against this, the TNPCB filed Civil Appeal which will be disposed of by the judgment delivered in this case. Finally, the NGT set aside the TNPCB order, against which, Civil Appeal were filed, which again will be disposed of by this judgment. Appellants herein raised the issue of maintainability of the Respondent's appeal before the NGT, stating that an appeal should have been filed first before the appellate authority under the Air Act/the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 ["NGT Act"]. This ground of maintainability was decided against the Appellants by the impugned order dated 08.08.2013. Both the Respondent as well as the Appellants made their detailed comments on the Committee's report. The NGT then heard final arguments and dictated the impugned order on 15.12.2018, in which it substantially accepted the Committee's recommendations. In doing so, it set aside the six impugned orders in the composite appeal. One major bone of contention of both the State of Tamil Nadu as well as the TNPCB in this case is that the appeal before the NGT is not maintainable and hence, the order is without jurisdiction.

Held, while disposing of the appeals

1. An appeal is a creature of statute and an appellate tribunal has to act strictly within the domain prescribed by statute. It An appeal would lie from an order or decision of the appellate authority under Section 28 of the Water Act to the NGT only Under Section 33B(a) of the Water Act read with Section 16(a) of the NGT Act. Similarly, an appeal would lie from an order or decision of the appellate authority under Section 31 of the Air Act to the NGT only Under Section 31B of the Air Act read with Section 16(f) of the NGT Act. Obviously, since no order or decision had been made by the appellate authority under either the Water Act or the Air Act, any direct appeal against an original order to the NGT would be incompetent. NGT's jurisdiction being strictly circumscribed by Section 33B of the Water Act, read with Section 31B of the Air Act, read with Section 16(a) and (f) of the NGT Act, would make it clear that it is only orders or decisions of the appellate authority that are appealable, and not original orders. On the facts of the present case, it is clear that an appeal was pending before the appellate authority, when the NGT set aside the original order dated 09.04.2018. This being the case, the NGT's order being clearly outside its statutory powers conferred by the Water Act, the Air Act, and the NGT Act, would be an order passed without jurisdiction.[31]

2. So far as the order dated 8th August, 2013 is concerned, It is seen how the NGT stated that the doctrine of necessity would take over if an appellate authority under the Act is not properly constituted so that no appeal can then be effectively preferred. This, again, is an argument that cannot be countenanced. If an appellate authority is either not yet constituted, or not properly constituted, a leapfrog appeal to the NGT cannot be countenanced. NGT is only conferred appellate jurisdiction from an order passed in exercise of first appeal. Where there is no such order, the NGT has no jurisdiction.[45]

3. Respondent's plant has been shut down since 9th April, 2018. Since impugned judgments of the NGT is set aside on the ground of maintainability, the order dated 22nd January, 2019 passed by the TNPCB, being a consequential order, is also set aside. The Respondents are relegated to the position that the six orders impugned before the NGT, dealt with by the impugned judgment dated 15.12.2018, and the order dated 29.03.2013, dealt with by the final judgment dated 08.08.2013, are alive and operative. Given the fact that NGT judgments involved in these appeals are set aside on the ground of maintainability, it will be open for the Respondents to file a writ petition in the High Court against all the aforesaid orders. If such writ petition is filed, it will be open for the Respondent to apply for interim reliefs considering that their plant has been shut down since 09.04.2018. Also, since their plant has been so shut down for a long period, and they are exporting a product which is an important import substitute, the Respondent may apply to the Chief Justice of the High Court for expeditious hearing of the writ petition, which will be disposed of on merits notwithstanding the availability of an alternative remedy in the case of challenge to the 09.04.2018 order of the TNPCB. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.[45]

JUDGMENT
Rohinton Fali Nariman, J.
1. The present appeals arise out of orders that have been passed by the National Green Tribunal ["NGT"] dated 31.05.2013, 08.08.2013, and 15.12.2018. The brief facts necessary to appreciate the controversy raised in the present case are as follows.
2. The Respondent, Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd./Vedanta Ltd., was operating a copper smelter plant at the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd. (SIPCOT) Industrial Complex at Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. On 01.08.1994, the Respondent received a No-Objection Certificate ["NOC"] from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board ["TNPCB"] for the production of blister copper and sulphuric acid. The environmental clearance to the project by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change ["MoEF"] followed on 16.01.1995. On 17.05.1995, the State MoEF also granted environmental clearance to the Respondent. The TNPCB granted its consent under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 ["Air Act"] and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 ["Water Act"] on 22.05.1995. After obtaining the requisite permissions, the consent to operate the plant was issued on 14.10.1996 by the TNPCB. Production commenced on 01.01.1997. However, the environmental clearances that were granted were challenged before the Madras High Court in Writ Petition Nos. 15501-15503/1996, 5769/1997, and 16961/1998. On 20.05.1999, the TNPCB granted its consent for production of two more products, namely, phosphoric acid and hydrofluorosilicic acid. On 21.09.2004, a Supreme Court Monitoring Committee was constituted to verify the compliance status of hazardous waste management. It recommended to the MoEF that the environmental clearance for the proposed expansion should not be granted, and if granted, should be revoked. On 19.04.2005, the TNPCB issued consent to operate, subject to fulfillment of various conditions for the expanded capacity. Meanwhile, the Madras High Court, on 28.09.2010, allowed the various writ petitions that had been filed and quashed the environmental clearances granted to the Respondent and directed the TNPCB to close down the plant.
3. Meanwhile, on 23.03.2013, the residents of nearby areas started complaining of irritation, throat infection, severe cough, breathing problem, nausea etc. due to emissions from Sterlite Industries. Reports were obtained after inspection of the premises by the TNPCB. Based on these reports, the TNPCB issued a show-cause notice dated 24.03.2013 and directed closure of the unit Under Section 31A of the Air Act on 29.03.2013. This order was stayed by the NGT on 31.05.2013, allowing the Respondent to commence production subject to certain conditions. Against this, the TNPCB filed Civil Appeal Nos. 4763-4764 of 2013, which will be disposed of by the judgment delivered in this case. Finally, on 08.08.2013, the NGT set aside the TNPCB order dated 29.03.2013, against which, Civil Appeal Nos. 8773-8774 of 2013 were filed, which again will be disposed of by this judgment. It is important to note that the Appellants herein raised the issue of maintainability of the Respondent's appeal before the NGT, stating that an appeal should have been filed first before the appellate authority under the Air Act/the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 ["NGT Act"]. This ground of maintainability was decided against the Appellants by the impugned order dated 08.08.2013.
4. Owing to various interim orders passed by the NGT, the Respondent continued to operate its plant. On 13.04.2016, the TNPCB granted consent to operate the plant for one year subject to certain conditions. Post inspection of the unit of the Respondent in March 2017, the TNPCB issued a show-cause notice dated 14.03.2017 for violations under the Air Act and the Water Act which, apparently, was not pursued. On 06.09.2017, an inspection report by the TNPCB was made, and an order passed on 07.09.2017, granting renewal of consent to operate only till 31.03.2018 subject to various conditions. Meanwhile, a protest had been organized in March 2018 by some persons against the proposed expansion sought by the Respondent. The Respondent, therefore, had to file Writ Petition No. 7313 of 2018 before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court for police protection. This Writ Petition was disposed of by an order dated 04.04.2018 with a direction to consider the Respondent's application. On 09.04.2018, the TNPCB refused renewal of consent to operate to the Respondent's unit based on non-compliance with certain conditions that were laid down under the Air Act and the Water Act. On 12.04.2018, the Respondent filed Appeal Nos. 36-37 of 2018 before the appellate authority Under Section 28 of the Water Act. In these appeals, various orders were passed, until, on 06.06.2018, the following order was passed:
APPLICATIONS 28 & 29/2018, APPLICATIONS 30 & 31/2018 AND APPEALS 36 & 37/2018:
Heard.
In view of the Government Order passed by the Government of Tamilnadu in G.O. Ms. No: 72, Environment & Forests (EC-3) Department Dated: 28.5.2018, directing the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board to close the plant permanently, we feel it is not appropriate to hear the Appeals and decide the issue at this juncture.
Hence the Appeals and applications are adjourned to 10.7.2018.
On 10.07.2018, the matter was further adjourned as follows:
APPLICATIONS 28 & 29/2018, APPLICATIONS 30 & 31/2018 AND APPEALS 36 & 37/2018:
In view of the remarks made in the adjudication proceedings on 6.6.2018 and as the position is same now, the Appeals and Applications are adjourned to 21.8.2018.
Finally, on 18.12.2018, i.e., three days after the impugned order was passed by the NGT on 15.12.2018, an order passed by the appellate authority was as follows:
APPLICATIONS 28, 29, 30 & 31/2018 AND APPEALS 36 & 37/2018:
Ms. Janani, counsel for the Appellant and Mr. V. Vasanthakumar, counsel for the Respondent-Board are present. None is present on behalf of the 1st, 2st and 3st interveners.
Counsel for the Appellant seeks permission to withdraw the Appeals. She has also filed a memo to that effect.
In view of the order passed by the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi on 15.12.2018 in Appeal No. 87 of 2018 setting aside the impugned order dated 9.4.2018 which is subject matter of these appeals pending before this Appellate Authority, the Appeals have become infructuous and hence they are closed.
5. On 12.04.2018, an order was passed by the TNPCB Under Section 33A of the Water Act and Section 31A of the Air Act directing that the Respondent's unit shall not resume production without obtaining prior approval/renewal or consent from the TNPCB. This was followed by two orders, both dated 23.05.2018, again issued under the same Sections, this time to close down the Respondent's unit and disconnect power supply to it. Finally, on 28.05.2018, an order was issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu Under Section 18(1)(b) of the Water Act stating:
It is brought to the notice of the Government that Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board did not renew the Consent to Operate to M/s. Vedanta Limited, Copper Smelter Plant, SIPCOT Industrial Complex, Thoothukudi District in its order dated 9.4.2018. Subsequently, on 23.5.2018, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has also issued directions for closure and disconnection of power supply to the Unit. The power supply has been disconnected on 24.5.2018.
2. Under Article 48-A of the Constitution, "the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country".
3. Under Sections, 18(1)(b) of the Water Act, 1974 in the larger public interest, the Government endorse the closure direction of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and also direct the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to seal the unit and close the plant permanently.
6. On the same date, the TNPCB issued a letter to the District Collector, inter alia, directing him to seal the Respondent's unit. These six orders became the subject matter of a composite Appeal No. 87 of 2018 Under Section 16 of the NGT Act.
7. A writ petition was filed by the Respondent before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on 18.06.2018 so that the Respondent could access its unit to maintain its plant. This was dismissed as withdrawn on 09.07.2018.
8. The Appellants then took up a plea of maintainability of the composite appeal. As this was not being disposed of by the NGT, this Court, by its order dated 17.08.2018, directed the NGT to render its final findings, both on maintainability as well as on merits. On 20.08.2018, the NGT constituted a Committee to go into the material produced by the parties to the Civil Appeal and to visit the site. This Committee was ultimately headed by Justice Tarun Agarwala, former Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court, together with two experts, one being a representative of the Central Pollution Control Board ["CPCB"] and another a representative of the MoEF. Aggrieved by this order, the Appellants knocked on the doors of this Court. This Court disposed of this appeal on 10.09.2018, by stating:
By our order dated 17.08.2018, we had made it clear that the NGT may continue to hear the matter both on merits as well as on maintainability and finally decide the matter on both counts.
Since our order is not referred to in the order dated 20.08.2018 passed by the NGT, we need only to state that once the Committee's report is given to the Tribunal, it will proceed to decide the matter in accordance with our order dated 17.08.2018.
xxx xxx xxx
A review petition that was filed against this order was dismissed.
9. The Committee constituted by the NGT then inspected the site on various dates in September/October, 2018, and heard all concerned parties as well as intervenors. It then came out with a detailed Enquiry Report dated 20.11.2018, in which it concluded as follows:
On the basis of the site visit, public hearing and after hearing the Appellant Company, State of Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and the interveners and, upon consideration of the issues raised, the Committee is of the opinion:
1. The impugned orders cannot be sustained as it is against the principles of natural justice.
No notice or opportunity of hearing was given to the Appellant.
2. The grounds mentioned in the impugned orders are not that grievous to justify permanent closure of the factory.
3. Other issues raised also does not justify the closure of the factory even if the Appellant was found to be violating the conditions/norms/directions.
4. In the event the Hon'ble Tribunal is of the opinion that the factory should commence production, the committee is of the opinion that the following directions may be issued.
a) As per condition No. 44 of the Consent Order dated 19-04-2005, the Appellant should be directed to monitor ground water quality including heavy metals such as Arsenic, Cadmium, Silver, Copper, Fluoride, etc. in and around the factory premises and nearby villages once a month and such report should be furnished to the TNPCB.
b) The sampling of the above should be taken in the presence of an official from TNPCB.
c) In addition to the above, the sampling of effluent/emission and solid waste should also be done by a monitoring group to be constituted by TNPCB comprising a representative of the District Collector, an official of TNPCB, NGOs and academicians as per condition No. 43 of Consent Order dated 19-04-2005.
d) Both the reports should be sent by TNPCB to CPCB for analysis. Recommendations made by CPCB should be followed.

x) TNPCB should be directed to commission "Regional Environmental Impact Assessment Study" in and around Tuticorin District by engaging a reputed national agency.
y) CPCB recommendations as contained in the order of NGT, dated 20.08.2018 to be complied with.
Both the Respondent as well as the Appellants made their detailed comments on the Committee's report. The NGT then heard final arguments and dictated the impugned order on 15.12.2018, in which it substantially accepted the Committee's recommendations. In doing so, it set aside the six impugned orders in the composite appeal. One major bone of contention of both the State of Tamil Nadu as well as the TNPCB in this case is that the appeal before the NGT is not maintainable and hence, the order dated 15.12.2018 is without jurisdiction.
10. As a postscript to this order, the TNPCB looked into the matter again, and issued yet another rejection letter dated 22.01.2019, by which the Respondent's application seeking renewal of consent to operate was rejected, stating that the conditions of various previous consents over the last 20 years had not been followed.
11. We have heard wide-ranging arguments from learned Counsel appearing on behalf of all the parties as well as the intervenors, on maintainability as well as on merits. Since we will be deciding this case on maintainability alone, we have not ventured to state anything on the merits of the case.
12. Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the TNPCB, showed us various provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and the NGT Act and argued that the six impugned orders before the NGT were orders which could not have been corrected by the NGT. Insofar as the first order dated 09.04.2018 was concerned, an appeal was pending before the appellate authority, as a result of which, the NGT, when it set aside the said order, could not have done so. Similarly, the orders dated 12.04.2018, 23.05.2018, and 28.05.2018, made Under Section 33A of the Water Act and Section 31A of the Air Act, were composite orders issued. As orders Under Section 31A of the Air Act were not appealable to the NGT either under the Air Act or Under Section 16 of the NGT Act, the Tribunal acted without jurisdiction in interfering with these orders. Further, the order dated 28.05.2018, issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu Under Section 18 of the Water Act, was certainly not an appealable order under either the Water Act or the NGT Act, and could only have been corrected in judicial review in a writ petition filed Under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or in a suit before a Civil Court. According to him, therefore, the setting aside of such an order was also completely without jurisdiction. Shri K.V. Viswanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu, added to these submissions. He cited some of our judgments as well as statutes and judgments of the English Courts to show that once an appeal is available to an appellate authority, after which an appeal lies to the NGT, a party cannot leapfrog directly to the NGT. Apart from this, the learned Senior Advocate also argued, based on the scheme of the Water Act, Air Act, and NGT Act, that all the appeals filed before the NGT were incompetent. Shri Guru Krishnakumar, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the TNPCB, also went on to criticize the order passed by the NGT dated 08.08.2013 on maintainability. According to him, no doctrine of necessity could be imported if an appellate tribunal was not constituted, as a result of which an appeal could not be argued before the appellate authority. Consequently, a leapfrog appeal would not be maintainable before the NGT. According to the learned Senior Advocate, this order also had to be set aside for the reason that even assuming that the appellate authority was not constituted on the date on which an appeal could have been preferred to it, the NGT, being a second appellate tribunal, would not have jurisdiction, and that either a suit or a writ petition Under Article 226 would have to be filed against the original order.
13. As against these arguments, Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the Respondents in all three appeals, sought to sustain the order of the NGT in these three appeals. The learned Senior Advocate painstakingly took us through all the orders that were impugned before the NGT, together with the relevant provisions of the Air Act, the Water Act, and the NGT Act. According to the learned Senior Advocate, so far as the order dated 09.04.2018 is concerned, thanks to a government affidavit filed, the appeal before the appellate authority had become infructuous, as a result of which, a direct appeal to the NGT would obviously become maintainable. Insofar as the combined orders Under Sections 33A and 31A of the Water Act and the Air Act, respectively, are concerned, according to him, an express appeal is provided to the NGT against orders passed Under Section 33A of the Water Act, and even if there is no appeal provided Under Section 31A of the Air Act, yet, as four out of five items in these orders dealt with the Water Act, the order could be stated to be substantially an order under the Water Act, and therefore, appealable as such. He added that, in any case, such orders could be corrected Under Section 14 of the NGT Act to avoid piecemeal litigation. Further, in any case, according to the learned Senior Advocate, a direction made Under Section 31A of the Air Act is undoubtedly equivalent to an order made Under Section 31 of the Air Act, and therefore, would be expressly appealable Under Section 16 of the NGT Act. Another without prejudice argument was made, that assuming all other arguments failed, these matters are only procedural, and therefore, appeals must necessarily land up before the expert tribunal which is so constituted as an expert tribunal to deal with all matters relating to the environment. For this, he referred to and relied strongly upon Sections 14, 15, 29, and 33 of the NGT Act. Insofar as the attack made upon the order dated 28.05.2018 of the Government of Tamil Nadu Under Section 18 of the Water Act is concerned, Shri Sundaram argued that on a proper construction of Section 18 read with the other provisions of the Water Act, only a general order, dealing with general matters, could be passed under the said Section, and not an order to shut down one particular industry. Since the Section 18 order purports to deal with only one particular industry, it is non est and liable to be ignored. An alternate argument made is that even though the order states that it is made Under Section 18, it can otherwise be traced to Section 29 of the Water Act as an order made in revision, and would, therefore, be appealable as such. The learned Senior Advocate then argued that, in any case, this is an order by which a direction has been made by the State Government to the TNPCB and, therefore, does not directly affect his client. He also argued that when this order was challenged before the NGT, the defence of the Government and the TNPCB would be that this is an order which, though binding on the TNPCB, would also impact the Respondent. This being the case, the NGT could always go into whether such a defence is a valid defence, and could, therefore, decide the matter. He also went on to state that the NGT is an expert body constituted specifically under a special Act, which is far better equipped than the High Court Under Article 226 exercising its powers in the writ jurisdiction, and therefore, all matters dealing with the environment should necessarily be decided by the NGT alone. He also relied upon our judgment in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and Ors., MANU/SC/0261/1997 : (1997) 3 SCC 261 ["L. Chandra Kumar"], in which it has been made clear that Tribunals can exercise powers of judicial review and that, therefore, being the equivalent of a High Court, the NGT could, in exercise of its powers of judicial review, have interfered with the State Government's orders passed Under Section 18 of the Water Act.
14. Having heard learned Counsel for all parties, it is important first to advert to the provisions of the three Acts in question.

26. Provision regarding existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent.--Where immediately before the commencement of this Act any person was discharging any sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or sewer or on land, the provisions of Section 25 shall, so far as may be, apply in relation to such person as they apply in relation to the person referred to in that Section subject to the modification that the application for consent to be made Under Sub-section (2) of that Section shall be made on or before such date as may be specified by the State Government by notification in this behalf in the Official Gazette.

18. It is important now to advert to both the orders dated 08.08.2013 and 15.12.2018, insofar as they deal with the maintainability of the appeals before them.
19. By the judgment of the NGT dated 08.08.2013, the NGT disposed of the plea on maintainability as follows:
62. Another aspect that would support the view that we are taking is the doctrine of necessity. Wherever in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is absolutely inevitable for a person to exercise another right available to it under the statute and where it is unable to exercise the preliminary right of appeal because of non-existence or non-proper constitution of the appellate authority and for its effective and efficacious exercise of right, it becomes necessary for the Appellant-company to invoke another remedy, then the same would be permitted unless it was so specifically barred by law governing the subject and the rights of the parties. It was upon the Appellant-company, particularly keeping in view the emergent situation created by issuance of the order dated 29th March, 2013, to avail of its right to appeal without any undue delay and as was rightly done by it within two days of the passing of the order. The unit of the Appellant-company had been directed to be shut down and the Appellant-company obviously could not have taken recourse to the remedy Under Section 31 of the Air Act as the authority itself was not properly constituted and was not functional. Besides the aid of the doctrine of necessity, the Appellant-company has also placed its reliance on Section 31B of the Air Act. An appeal against the order passed by the appellate authority in exercise of its powers Under Section 31 of the Air Act lies to the NGT in terms of Section 31B of the Air Act. In other words, the appellate order passed by the proper authority Under Section 31 of the Air Act is appealable to the NGT in terms of Section 31B. Thus, the NGT is the appellate authority of the appellate authority constituted Under Section 31 of the Air Act by the State Government. The Appellant-company has itself given up its right of first appeal before the appellate authority in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. The Respondents have placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Manohar Lal v. Union of India, (2010) 11 SCC 557 where the Court had taken the view that no higher authority in the hierarchy or an appellate or revisional authority can exercise the power of the statutory authority nor the superior authority can mortgage its wisdom and direct the statutory authority to act in a particular manner. Firstly this judgment on facts and law has no application to the present case. Secondly, the non-constitution of the authority itself would bring the present case outside the application of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Manohar Lal (supra).
63. We are unable to contribute ourselves to the contention raised that a direction passed Under Section 31A of the Air Act is not covered under the expression 'order' used in Section 31 of the Air Act. Any direction essentially would contain an element of order as it requires and calls upon the parties to comply with the same. 'Direction' itself means an order; an instruction how to proceed, like the judge's direction to the jury, while 'Order' is defined as a command, direction or instruction. This is how the Black's Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, refers to these two expressions. In other words, they can be used as synonyms. They are not conflicting terms and one can be read into the other. Thus, we find no substance in this contention raised on behalf of the Respondents.
64. An appellate authority, which is constituted under the statute, is completely distinct and different from an administrative authority constituted otherwise even to deal with adjudicatory proceedings. In the case of an appellate authority, it must satisfy the existence de facto and must function de jure, in accordance with law. If the appellate authority itself was not in conformity with the notification, it cannot be said that it could function in accordance with law without constitution of the three Member appellate authority. The cumulative effect of this discussion is that the objection in regard to maintainability is without any substance and is liable to be rejected. In view of this finding, it is not necessary for us to examine whether this could be treated as a petition Under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act (for short 'the NGT Act') even if it was not maintainable in view of the objection taken by the Respondent in regard to maintainability of the present appeal.
20. Insofar as the judgment dated 15.12.2018 is concerned, the NGT, on maintainability, held as follows:
44. It is undisputed that this Tribunal is an Appellate Authority as far as orders of closure under the Air Act and the Water Act are concerned. The impugned orders dated 12.04.2018, 23.05.2018 and 28.05.2018 are such orders. Mere fact that an appeal against the order declining renewal of Consent to Operate is provided for and was filed cannot be in the facts and circumstances of the present case, be a bar to exercise of powers of the Appellate Authority by this Tribunal. As already noted, the Appellate Authority has declined to proceed with the matter. The grounds in the impugned orders dated 09.04.2018, 12.04.2018, 23.05.2018 and 28.05.2018 are identical. If the appeals are held to be not maintainable, the Appellant will be without any remedy against the order of closure. Order of the Appellate Authority is also appealable before this Tribunal Under Section 16(f) of the NGT Act, 2010. We, thus, do not find any merit in this case in the objections of the Respondent.
45. Mere fact that the State of Tamil Nadu also endorsed the order of the TNPCB and that order of the State is not appealable to this Tribunal, does not deviate from the legal position that order of TNPCB is appealable to this Tribunal. Moreover, order of the State of Tamil Nadu is not a policy matter but mere endorsement of order of the TNPCB.
46. The judgments relied upon by the Respondents are distinguishable. Unlike Educanti Kistamma v. Deokar's Distillery [(2003) 5 SCC 669], this is not a case where the first order has not been challenged. Challenge before us is to the first order as well as subsequent orders. Basis for all the orders is common.
xxx xxx xxx
48. The order of the Government of Tamil Nadu issued Under Section 18(1)(b) of the Water Act also cannot be said to be an independent order but relied on and endorsing the views of the TNPCB which is under challenge and that are not sufficient for ordering closure or refusal to grant even consent. If there are no other materials for the Government of Tamil Nadu to arrive at conclusion of closure on the ground of irreversible pollution being caused to the environment allowing the unit to function, then it cannot be said to be a policy decision to close down the industry permanently and if any order was passed based on the order by the Pollution Control Board, without independent application of mind and arbitrarily, then that can also be incidentally considered by the Tribunal for the purpose of deciding the question of legality of that order. So, under the present circumstances, it is not a case of this Tribunal entertaining the appeals where there is inherent lack of jurisdiction to entertain the same.
49. In the present proceedings, as already noted, the Appellate Authority having declined to proceed with the matter and the order of closure being appealable before this Tribunal, there is no ground to reject the appeal on the ground of maintainability so as to deprive the Appellant any judicial remedy in the matter.
(I) Re: Order dated 09.04.2018
21. This order is an order which rejected renewal of consent to operate, and therefore, is traceable to Section 27 of the Water Act and Section 21 of the Air Act. There is no doubt whatsoever that an appeal against an order made Under Section 27 of the Water Act is appealable to the appellate authority Under Section 28 of the said Act. Under Section 33B(a) of the said Act, if a person is aggrieved by an order or decision of the appellate authority Under Section 28, it is then appealable to the NGT. This is made clear also by Section 16(a) of the NGT Act. Equally, an order refusing consent Under Section 21 of the Air Act is appealable to the appellate authority Under Section 31 of the Air Act, and thereafter, from the said appellate authority's order, to the NGT, Under Section 31B of the Air Act and Section 16(f) of the NGT Act.
22. As has been stated hereinabove, it is clear that an appeal to the appellate authority under the Air Act and the Water Act was, in fact, preferred, being Appeal Nos. 36-37 of 2018. While these appeals were pending before the appellate authority, the composite Appeal No. 87 of 2018 was filed on 22.06.2018 before the NGT inter alia against the order of refusal of consent to operate dated 09.04.2018. Shri Sundaram, however, argued before us that the order dated 06.06.2018 made by the appellate authority, which we have set out hereinabove, makes it clear that the appeals could not be heard since the State Government had passed an order dated 28.05.2018 directing the TNPCB to close down the plant permanently. What is missed by Shri Sundaram is the fact that the said order expressly states that the appeals could not be decided at this juncture and were hence adjourned to 10.07.2018. The said appeals on 10.07.2018 were further adjourned, and it is only on 18.12.2018 that they were finally withdrawn as being infructuous in view of the fact that the NGT had passed its order on 15.12.2018 in which it had set aside the order dated 09.04.2018.
23. What becomes clear from the above narration of facts is the fact that while an appeal was still pending before the appellate authority, the NGT took up a matter directly against the original order dated 09.04.2018 which was challenged before the appellate authority even before the appellate authority could decide the same. However, Shri Sundaram referred to Section 28(4) of the Air Act and Section 31(4) of the Water Act to argue that appeals to the appellate authority must be decided expeditiously, and if they were not so decided, an appeal would lie to the NGT against a decision by the appellate authority not to decide the matter before it expeditiously. This argument must also be negatived as, in point of fact, no appeal was preferred from any orders of the appellate authority adjourning the proceedings. As we have seen, an appeal was directly filed from the order of the TNPCB dated 09.04.2018.
24. At this point, it is important to advert to a few judgments of this Court. In Kundur Rudrappa v. Mysore Revenue Appellate Tribunal and Ors., MANU/SC/0528/1975 : (1975) 2 SCC 411, this Court, while dealing with Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, stated:
4. The point that arises for consideration is whether any appeal lay Under Section 64 of the Act to the State Transport Appellate Tribunal against the issue of a permit in pursuance of an earlier resolution of the Regional Transport Authority granting the permit. It is only necessary to read Section 64(1)(a) which is material for the purpose of this appeal:
64. (1)(a) Any person aggrieved by the refusal of the State or a Regional Transport Authority to grant a permit, or by any condition attached to a permit granted to him
...
may within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, appeal to the State Transport Appellate Tribunal constituted Under Sub-section (2), who shall, after giving such person and the original authority an opportunity of being heard, give a decision thereon which shall be final.
We are not required to consider the other clauses of Section 64(1) which are admittedly not relevant. Section 64 has to be read with Rule 178 of the Rules which prescribes the procedure for appeal to the various authorities.
5. Appeal is a creature of the statute. There is no dispute that Section 64 of the Act is the only Section creating rights of appeal against the grant of permit and other matters with which we are not concerned here. There is no appeal provided for Under Section 64 against an order issuing a permit in pursuance of the order granting the permit. Issuance of the permit is only a ministerial act necessarily following the grant of the permit. The appeals before the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and the further appeal to the Mysore Revenue Appellate Tribunal are, therefore, not competent Under Section 64 of the Act and both the tribunals had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeals and to interfere with the order of the Regional Transport Authority granting the permit which had already been affirmed in appeal by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and further in second appeal by the Mysore Revenue Appellate Tribunal. There was, therefore, a clear error of jurisdiction on the part of both the Tribunals in interfering with the grant of the permit to the Appellant. The High Court was, therefore, not right in dismissing the writ application of the Appellant which ought to have been allowed.
25. Similarly, in a concurring judgment of Sinha, J., in Cellular Operators Association of India and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., MANU/SC/1368/2002 : (2003) 3 SCC 186, the learned Judge observed:
27. TDSAT was required to exercise its jurisdiction in terms of Section 14-A of the Act. TDSAT itself is an expert body and its jurisdiction is wide having regard to Sub-section (7) of Section 14-A thereof. Its jurisdiction extends to examining the legality, propriety or correctness of a direction/order or decision of the authority in terms of Sub-section (2) of Section 14 as also the dispute made in an application Under Sub-section (1) thereof. The approach of the learned TDSAT, being on the premise that its jurisdiction is limited or akin to the power of judicial review is, therefore, wholly unsustainable. The extent of jurisdiction of a court or a tribunal depends upon the relevant statute. TDSAT is a creature of a statute. Its jurisdiction is also conferred by a statute. The purpose of creation of TDSAT has expressly been stated by Parliament in the amending Act of 2000. TDSAT, thus, failed to take into consideration the amplitude of its jurisdiction and thus misdirected itself in law.
