JUDGMENT
Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned Counsel.
3. Being aggrieved by the interim orders passed by the High Court, the Medical Council of India has approached this Court.
4. Upon perusal of the interim orders we find that the High Court has permitted the Respondent-College to admit certain students, though recognition of the Respondent-College was in dispute. In our opinion, such an interim order ought not to have been passed by the High Court.
5. In the circumstances, without expressing any opinion on the merits of these cases, we set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court. The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs. Pending applications stand disposed of.
6. We are sure that the High Court shall finally decide the petitions at an early date.
