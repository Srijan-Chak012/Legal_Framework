JUDGMENT
Dipak Misra, J.
1. In this batch of Writ Petitions preferred Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India the prayer relates to issue of a direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the Respondents to enforce appropriately the constitutional mandate as contained under the provisions of Articles 16(4-A), 16(4-B) and 335 of the Constitution of India or, in the alternative, directing the Respondents to constitute a Committee or appoint a Commission chaired either by a retired Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court in making: survey and collecting necessary qualitative data of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the services of the State for granting reservation in promotion in the light of direction gives by this Court in M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/4560/2006 : (2006) 8 SCC 212. Let it be clarified in the beginning, apart from this prayer, other reliefs sought for in the petitions have not been argued and rightly so, as the said grievances have already been directed to be dealt with in interlocutory applications to be filed in the case of U.P. Power Corporation Limited v. Rajesh Kumar and Ors. MANU/SC/0334/2012 : (2012) 7 SCC 1.
2. At the commencement of the hearing, Dr. K.S. Chauhan, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 715 of 2015, had submitted that the decision in M. Nagaraj (supra) by the Constitution Bench requires reconsideration. For the said purpose, he has made an effort to refer to certain passages from Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0104/1993 : (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 and R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0259/1995 : 1995 (2) SCC 745. We are not inclined to enter into the said issue as we are of the considered opinion that the pronouncement in M. Nagaraj (supra) is a binding precedent and has been followed in number of authorities and that apart, it has referred to, in detail, all other binding previous authorities of larger Benches and there does not appear any weighty argument to convince us, even for a moment, that the said decision requires any reconsideration. The submission on the said score is repelled.
