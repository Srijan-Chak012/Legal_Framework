Case Note:
Environment - Environmental Clearance - Grant of - Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 - An appeal was filed before Principal Bench of National Green Tribunal challenging grant of an Environmental Clearance for development of a greenfield international airport at Mopa in Goa - NGT, by its judgment came to conclusion that, present case "was not a case where project compromises with environment" - While affirming EC, the NGT came to conclusion that "further safeguards for environmental protection need to be incorporated" - NGT, accordingly, proceeded to formulate additional conditions, while affirming grant of EC - Whether EAC shall revisit recommendations made by it for grant of an EC.

Facts:

On 1 May 2000, the Government of India communicated its approval for the setting up of an airport at Mopa and for the closure of the existing airport for civilian operations on the commissioning of the new airport. Subsequently, on 1 July 2010, the earlier decision was modified to allow for the continuation of civilian aircraft operations at Dabolim even after the commissioning of the new airport. The process of land acquisition commenced in 2008 under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Originally, the land area anticipated for the development of the project was pegged at 4,500 acres. During the pendency of project appraisals, the area required for the proposed airport stood reduced to 2,271 acres. A Miscellaneous Application was filed by the State of Goa before the NGT on 2 July 2018 seeking permission for the felling of trees. By its judgment, the NGT disposed of both the appeals and the Miscellaneous Application filed by the State of Goa, upholding the EC and imposing additional conditions to safeguard the environment. This Court has been informed that the felling of trees was initiated on 3 September 2018 and completed on 14 January 2019. Assailing the judgment of the NGT, two appeals have been filed before this Court: one by Hanuman Laxman Aroskar and the other by the Federation of Rainbow Warriors. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants urged that the EIA report which is carried out under the terms of the 2006 notification is a tool to evaluate the environmental consequences of a proposed activity. The proposed international airport, being a Category 'A' project, is governed by the second, third and fourth stages of scoping, public consultation and appraisal respectively envisaged under the 2006 notification. In addition to the 2006 notification, the Guidance manual furnishes a significant sign post in the procedure envisaged prior to the grant of an EC. The project proponent is required to submit Form 1 complete with relevant details of the proposed project and the status of the environment. The ToR which is finalized by the EAC is founded on the disclosures which are made by the project proponent.

Held, while disposing of the appeal

1. EIA report prevaricated by recording that the area required for the proposed airport has only a few trees, mostly bushes. The EIA report states that vegetation and trees are sparse at the site. A photograph and a google map image are put forth as illustrations in figure 2.3 of Chapter II. To realise later that the project involved the felling of 54,676 trees is indicative of the cavalier approach to the issue and a process of fact finding which is parsimonious with the truth. Post facto explanations are inadequate to deal with a failure of due process in the field of environmental governance. Mathematical averages cannot displace factual data about the actual number of trees which were affected by the project. The EIA report ought to have scrutinized the number of trees, their nature and longevity. Issues such as the extent to which the trees or some of them were capable of being transplanted had to be considered in the EIA report. The location of the trees is also significant. In a given case, if the trees appear in clusters or in a dense formation in segments of the project site, it would be necessary to determine whether felling all of them was necessary for the project to be implemented.[97]

2. The Rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions. Responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making are key ingredients to the Rule of law. Public access to information is, in similar terms, fundamental to the preservation of the Rule of law. In a domestic context, environmental governance that is founded on the Rule of law emerges from the values of our Constitution. The health of the environment is key to preserving the right to life as a constitutionally recognized value under Article 21 of the Constitution. Proper structures for environmental decision making finds expression in the guarantee against arbitrary action and the affirmative duty of fair treatment under Article 14 of the Constitution.[140]

3. Repeatedly, it has been urged on behalf of the State of Goa, MoEFCC and the concessionaire that the need for a new airport is paramount with an increasing volume of passengers and consequently the flaws in the EIA process should be disregarded. The need for setting up a new airport is a matter of policy. The role of the decision makers entrusted with authority over the EIA process is to ensure that every important facet of the environment is adequately studied and that the impact of the proposed activity is carefully assessed. This assessment is integral to the project design because it is on that basis that a considered decision can be arrived at as to whether necessary steps to mitigate adverse consequences to the environment can be strengthened.[142]

4. In the present case, there has been a failure of due process commencing from the non-disclosure of vital information by the project proponent in Form 1. Disclosures in Form 1 are the underpinning for the preparation of the ToR. The EIA report, based on incomplete information has suffered from deficiencies which have been noticed in the earlier part of this judgment including the failure to acknowledge that within the study area contemplated by the Guidance manual, there is a presence of ESZs.[143]

5. The EAC, as an expert body abdicated its role and function by taking into account circumstances which were extraneous to the exercise of its power and failed to notice facets of the environment that were crucial to its decision making. The 2006 notification postulates that normally, the MoEFCC would accept the recommendation of the EAC. This makes the role of the EAC even more significant. The NGT is an adjudicatory body which is vested with appellate jurisdiction over the grant of an EC. The NGT dealt with the submissions which were urged before it in essentially one paragraph. It failed to comprehend the true nature of its role and power Under Section 16(h) and Section 20 of the NGT Act 2010. In failing to carry out a merits review, the NGT has not discharged an adjudicatory function which properly belongs to it.[144]

6. In this view of the matter, neither the process of decision making nor the decision itself can pass legal muster. Equally, as an area requiring balance between development of infrastructure and the environment, we are of the view that appropriate directions should be issued by this Court, which would ensure that while the need for a public project as significant as an international airport is duly factored into the decision making calculus, such development proceeds on a considered view of the importance of the prevailing state of the environment. Time bound directions should be issued.[145]

7. The EAC shall revisit the recommendations made by it for the grant of an EC, including the conditions which it has formulated, having regard to the specific concerns which have been highlighted in this judgment. The EAC shall carry out the exercise under (i) above within a period of one month of the receipt of a certified copy of this order. Until the EAC carries out the fresh exercise as directed above, the EC granted by the MoEFCC on 28 October 2015 shall remain suspended. Upon reconsidering the matter in terms of the present directions, the EAC, if it allows the construction to proceed will impose such additional conditions which in its expert view will adequately protect the concerns about the terrestrial eco systems noticed in this judgment. The EAC would be at liberty to lay down appropriate conditions concerning air, water, noise, land, biological and socio-economic environment;. The EAC shall have due regard to the assurance furnished by the concessionaire to this Court that it is willing to adopt and implement necessary safeguards bearing in mind international best practices governing greenfield airports.[147]

8. Matters concerning environmental governance concern not just the living, but generations to come. The protection of the environment, as an essential facet of human development, ensures sustainable development for today and tomorrow.[148]

9. The appeal is allowed.[150]
