Case Note:
Sales Tax - Entitlement to the benefit of Sales Tax incentive under "Capital Investment Incentive to Premier/Prestigious Unit Scheme, 1995-2000" on the principle of restitution and secondly, because the Respondents could not be made to lose the benefit under the Sales Tax Waiver Scheme, for an act of Court under challange?

Held, there was a reasonable doubt whether the Respondent's inability to avail benefit under the said Scheme was because of its own act or because of the act of the Appellant. This Court granted the stay order on 11th May, 2001 on the special leave petition filed by Essar, so the Respondents should have made an effort of obtaining the necessary licence by again coming to the Court. Admittedly Essar did not do it. Essar merely represented to the State for grant of licence. Assuming that the State had not responded favourably to the representation of Essar by giving the clearance, it was open to Essar to approach this Court for some order as its special leave petition was pending before this Court. Essar did not do it. Therefore, the question remained whether Essar acted with due diligence in obtaining the equitable remedy of restitution. At the same time, the State did not at all gain or receive any benefit as a result of the orders passed by the High Court on the second PILs. Therefore, the principle of restitution was not found applicable. Moreover, a mere mistake or error committed by Court cannot be a ground for restitution.

Civil - Undue advantage - Whether the orders of the High Court restraining Government of Gujarat from granting any further authorisation for laying pipelines in any part of the Sanctuary resulted in any undue advantage to Appellant?

Held, it could not be said that by the restraining order the Appellant had gained any undue advantage. On the contrary, twin objects of development of the backward areas and employment opportunities, which were sought to be achieved by the Appellant by floating the said scheme, were adversely affected.

Words and maxims - Actus curiae principle - Whether in respect of the order dated 13th July, 2000, 18th July, 2000, 20th July, 2000, 27th July, 2000 and 3rd August, 2000 of the High Court, later on reversed by this Court on 19th January, 2004 on a different interpretation of Section 29 of Wild Life Protection Act, the actus curiae principle can be invoked?

Held, Essar was categorically told by letter dated 28th May, 2002, which is much prior to the expiry of the period, that time for availing the exemption could not be extended. Admittedly, Essar failed to meet the deadline. In that factual scenario, the exercise undertaken by the High Court in the impugned judgment by directing various adjustments which virtually re-wrote the State's exemption scheme, was an exercise which was, with great respect, neither warranted in law nor supported by precedents. There was no question of equity here, an exemption was a stand alone process. Either an industry claiming exemption came within it or it did not.
Ratio Decidendi:
"The Court while granting restitution is required to restore the parties as far as possible to their same position as they were in at the time when the Court by its erroneous action displaced them."
"The obligation to restitute lies on the person or the authority that has received unjust enrichment or unjust benefit."
"Due diligence must be exhibited by the party to seek equity."

"In the case of a mere erroneous judgment of a Court the principle of actus curiae cannot be invoked."
JUDGMENT
A.K. Ganguly, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Gujarat dated 22.04.2008 in Special Civil Application No. 24233/2007, whereby the Respondent No. 1 herein, Essar Oil Limited (hereinafter "Essar") was given the benefit of Sales Tax incentive under the Government of Gujarat "Capital Investment Incentive to Premier/Prestigious Unit Scheme, 1995-2000" (hereinafter "the said Scheme")
3. The State Government in the Industries and Mines Department vide Resolution dated 11.09.1995 introduced the said scheme to accelerate development of the backward area of the State and to create large-scale employment opportunities.
4. The operative period of the said scheme was from 16.08.1995 upto 15.08.2000, during which new units have to go into commercial production.
5. The Scheme envisaged grant of Sales Tax incentives by way of Sales Tax Exemption or Sales Tax Deferment or Composite Schemes, for Premier/Prestigious Units according to the location, investment and status of the project. Essar fell in the category of premier unit i.e. new industrial unit having a project cost of more than Rs. 1,000/- crores and employing 100 workers on a regular basis and following the employment policy of the State Government. Clause (v) of the Scheme defined premier unit in the following terms:
(v) PREMIER UNIT
A new industrial unit or industrial complex fulfilling the following criteria will be considered for granting status of a "Premier Unit".
(a) The industrial unit shall have a project cost of Rs. 500 crores or more. Such units having project cost of Rs. 1,000 crores and above shall be entitled for extended period to avail incentive as provided under para 6 B.
(b) Only one unit per taluka will be eligible for the Premier Unit status. In banned area no unit is permitted.
(c) The unit shall employ at least 100 workers on a regular basis and shall follow the employment policy of the State Government.
6. Part II of the said Scheme provided that the rate of incentive would depend on the location, investment and status of the project. The incentives offered were sales-tax exemption or sales-tax deferment or composite scheme. There is no dispute about the fact that Essar opted for sales-tax deferment scheme. As per clause 6(i)(B), the rate of incentive applicable to Essar was the rate available for the most backward area. The extent of exemption was 125% of eligible fixed capital investment.
7. Part II Clause (iii) (b) provided that Under the Sales Tax Deferment incentive scheme, the recovery of sales tax connected by the unit on sale of goods manufactured by it including intermediate products, by products and scrap/waste generated as incidental to manufacturing activities and turnover tax, leviable to Government will be deferred and amount so deferred will be recovered in six equal annual installments by Sales Tax Department beginning from the financial year subsequent to the year in which the unit exhausts limit of incentive granted to it under the scheme or after the expiry of relevant period or time limit during which deferment is available or whichever is earlier.
8. Since Essar's investment was going to be more than Rs. 1,000 crores, the duration of incentive of sales- tax deferment was to be for a period of 17 years from the date of commercial production.
9. Clause 6 (v) of the said Scheme provided for effective steps for extending date of commercial production in the following terms:
6(v) Effective steps for extending date of commercial production:
The unit which cannot go into commercial production before expiry of the scheme will be allowed to go into commercial production beyond the last date of the scheme provided it has taken the following effective steps:
(1) The industrial unit should have obtained provisional registration as a Prestigious/Premier unit before 15th August 2000.
(2) 25% of project cost should have been incurred before 15th August 2000. The unit which has taken above effective steps will be allowed to go into commercial production as shown below:
(a) The unit with project cost above Rs. 100 crores but below Rs. 300 crores should go into commercial production on or before 15th August 2002.
(b) The unit with project cost more than Rs. 300 crores should go into commercial production on or before 15th February 2003.
Such units shall have to apply to industries Commissioner for extending date of commercial production by 31st August 2000.
10. A High Power State Level Committee (hereinafter "HPSLC") was the Sanctioning Authority for granting permanent registration of all the Prestigious/Premier Units
11. Part III provides the procedure for Registration for Premier/Prestigious Status, the relevant clause of the said Part in respect of instant case is set out below:
An Industrial unit eligible for Prestigious/Premier status under the scheme will apply to Industries Commissioner in prescribed form before expiry of the scheme along with details of following effective steps.
(i) Possession of plot or shed in GIDC Estate. For units located outside GIDC Estate, the unit must be in legal possession of land with valid non-agricultural use permission of industrial use or as per Revenue Act as modified from time to time.
(ii) The Letter of intent/Letter of Approval or Registration/ obtained receipt against filling of IEM to the appropriate authority.
(iii) NOC of GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board)
(iv) Detailed Project Report.
The following procedure will be adopted for granting the temporary and permanent Prestigious/Premier registration.
(a) The Industries Commissioner shall give provisional registration to the eligible prestigious/premier unit after approval of committee where applicable.
(b) The eligible unit after completion of project will apply to Industries Commissioner for permanent prestigious/premier registration, Industries Commissioner will carryout the assets verification and submit a verification report to the High Power State Level Committee, for granting permanent registration.
12. Some relevant facts which arose prior to the floating of the Scheme and which are necessary for appreciating the said Scheme, as contended by Essar and which the records also shows, are as under.
13. Essar was encouraged by the State Government to set up a major venture at Vadinar in Jamnagar District of Gujarat as a 100% export oriented unit for refining of petroleum products with a capacity of 9 Million Tons per annum at an estimated project cost of Rs. 1900 crores in collaboration with M/s Bechtel Inc., USA.
14. By letter dated 11th April, 1990, the then Chief Minister of the State of Gujarat wrote to the Ministry of Planning, Government of India, stating that the project was expected to generate foreign exchange earnings of over Rs. 3000 crores within a period of 5 years and that it was expected to be set up in 36 months. It was anticipated by the State Government that the project would "completely change the face of the Vadinar area, which is traditionally a backward area of Gujarat offering direct and indirect employment and will encourage growth of various other ancillary industries in that region". The letter further said that the project had the full support of the Government of Gujarat and it was being accorded highest priority and that Essar's proposal for setting up the oil refinery should be cleared by the Government of India urgently. The clearance for setting up the oil refinery was then granted by the Government of India.
15. In January, 1993, Essar applied to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for grant of a 'No Objection Certificate' to establish the refinery for manufacturing several kinds of petroleum products. By letter dated 15th February, 1993, the GPCB stated that it had no objection from the Environmental Pollution potential point of view in the setting up of the refinery project subject to certain environmental pollution control measures to be taken by the Appellant. Essar's proposal regarding the environmental pollution control system was approved by the GPCB on 17th April, 1993 and a Site Clearance Certificate was issued on that date.
16. On 10.11.1994, Essar filed an application for right of way over 15.49 hectares of forest land for laying Submarine Crude Oil Pipeline, Cooling Water/Return Water Pipeline and Product Jetty for establishment of its Refinery Project at Vadinar, District Jamnagar, to the Conservator of Forests, Marine National Park, Jamnagar. Undisputedly, 15.49 hectares of forest land applied for includes 8.79 hectares of Jamnagar Marine National Park and Sanctuary. Therefore, permission under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act ("FCA") was required for the entire 15.49 hectares. At the same time, permission of State Government was required under the Wildlife Protection Act ("WPA") for 8.79 hectares.
17. On 13.02.1995, the State Government requested the Chief Conservator of Forests, Regional Office, Western Region, Bhopal, to move the Government of India to issue suitable orders to allow Essar to make geophysical survey in Marine National Park/Sanctuary area. The proposal was forwarded by the Chief Conservator of Forests, Bhopal to the Government of India on 15.05.1995.
18. The Conservator of Forests recommended and forwarded the proposal of Essar for Right of Way to the Chief Conservator of Forests (WL) by letter dated 2nd June, 1995 along with an application in the prescribed form seeking prior approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of FCA. The application with its enclosures together with the recommendation of the State Government that 15.49 hectares of forest land be made available to the Appellant, was forwarded to the Central Government by the Central Chief Conservator of Forests on 3rd February, 1997. Upon receipt of the proposal of the State Government, the Central Government constituted a team for joint inspection of the area. The report of the joint inspection team was that the proposed activity of the Appellant would not have much ramification from the forestry point of view and the damage would only be temporary in nature in a localized area during the construction phase.
19. On 08.09.1995, the State Government in its Forests and Environment Department informed the Government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, inter alia, that the approval "in principle" was granted to Essar to install Single Buoy Mooring / Crude Oil Terminal / Jetty and connecting pipeline in the National Marine Park and Sanctuary area in Vadinar, District Jamnagar on the terms and conditions to be decided in due course by the State Government.
20. On 11.09.1995 the said Scheme was announced and thereafter on 01.02.1996 Essar applied in the new format to the Industries Commissioner, Gandhinagar for registering the Industrial Undertaking as a "Premier/Prestigious Unit" under the said Scheme.
21. On 29.05.1996 the Forest and Environment Department, State of Gujarat made a proposal to Government of India seeking approval under Section 2 of FCA for diversion of 15.49 hectares of forest land for construction and operation of certain offshore and onshore facilities for a grass root refinery project of Essar.
22. On the basis of the letter-dated 30.09.1997 of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, the State Government conveyed on 16.10.1997 its permission under Section 29 of WPA to Essar's proposal of right to way through the National Park and Sanctuary subject to Essar's compliance with certain terms and conditions including obtaining permission of the Central Government under the FCA, 1980 (which was granted on 08.12.1999, mentioned later) and also getting clearance under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Regulations, which was granted on 03.11.2000.
23. This permission was conveyed to Essar by the Conservator of Forests under cover of his letter- dated 18.10.1997. The permission was, however, restricted to the Kandla Port Trust area. Kandla Port Trust granted permission to Essar to install "marine facilities" on 10.10.1997.
24. On 27.11.1997 the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India granted "in-principle" approval to Essar under FCA, 1980 for diverting 15.49 hectares of forest land for non-forest purpose.
25. On 25.06.1999 Essar was issued the provisional Premier Registration Certificate by the Industries Commissioner. The provisional certificate was valid upto 15.08.2000 i.e. the last date of Scheme, within this time period Essar was obliged to start commercial production, failing which Essar would have to apply for extension of date of commercial production.
26. In the meantime in view of the permissions granted to install "marine facilities", Essar started construction work of laying of water in-take jetty and product jetty in the forest area of Marine National Park and Marine Sanctuary. Essar's grievances are that despite the aforesaid permissions being given to them for construction, the State Forest Department forced Essar to stop work and further lodged on 19.3.1999 a criminal complaint against Essar and its contractor, for offence committed under Sections 17 (A), 29, 35 (6), 51 (1) and 58 of the WPA and Section 26 of the Indian Forests Act.
27. In April 1999, a writ petition being Special Civil Application No. 2840/1999 in the nature of Public Interest Litigation was filed before the High Court of Gujarat by one Halar Utkarsh Samiti (hereinafter "Samiti") alleging serious violations of several environmental legislations on the part of Essar, who was impleaded as Respondent No. 4 in the petition.
28. By interim order-dated 20.04.1999 passed in that PIL High Court directed Essar not to carry on any construction activity in the Marine National Sanctuary and Marine National Park in violation of the statutory provisions including the provisions contained in Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972.
29. By order-dated 20.08.1999 the High Court disposed of the said PIL in which Essar undertook to file an Undertaking to the effect that they would not carry out any construction activities at the site in question, without obtaining the approval from the authorities. Pursuant to the said order, on 28.09.1999 Essar filed an undertaking to the following effect:
...no construction activities or marine facilities will be undertaken without obtaining the approval from the authorities including those which are under process before the authorities.
This undertaking is given without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the Respondent No. 4.
This undertaking will come to an end as and when the permission is granted by the authorities.
30. In the meantime on 09.09.1999, a charge sheet was filed against the officers of Essar and its contractor in respect of earlier mentioned offences allegedly committed by them under the WPA and FCA.
31. On 08.12.1999 the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India granted approval under Section 2 of the FCA for the total land of 15.49 hectares of forest land.
32. In April 2000, said Samiti filed another PIL being Special Civil Application No. 1778, and subsequently two other PILs were also filed by one Jan Sangarsh Manch and one Shri Alpesh Y. Kogje, being Civil Application Nos. 5476 and 5928 of 2000, (hereinafter "second PILs") in the High Court of Gujarat challenging, inter alia, the permission granted by the State Government to one Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd. ('BORL') to lay pipeline in the Marine National Park and Sanctuary Area. It is pertinent to note here that Essar was not a party to these petitions.
33. On 29.04.2000 the Government of Gujarat discontinued the said Scheme with effect from 01.01.2000. However, vide the same Government Resolution dated 29.04.2000, it was specifically mentioned that industry units in pipelines cases which have been registered should start production within two years from January 1, 2000 failing which such units shall be rendered ineligible for sales tax incentive. Therefore, the time to start commercial production was thus extended to 01.01.2002. It is common ground that Essar, being a registered unit, was entitled to the benefit of the said extension.
34. Before the High Court, when proceedings in respect of the second PILs were going on, the counsel of Government of Gujarat placed a copy of the letter- dated 25.07.2000. Relying on the letter, the High Court noted that there were two more pending proposals for laying pipeline in the Marine Park/Sanctuary Area with the State Government - one from Essar and the other from one Gujarat Poshitra Port Ltd.
35. Before the High Court, the State Government submitted that the proposal from Essar for laying down pipelines in Marine National Park and Marine Sanctuary, Vadinar in Jamnagar District has been only approved 'in principle' vide letter-dated 08.09.1995. However, formal sanction under Section 29 of the WPA, 1972 is yet to be given by the State Government.
36. By judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 the High Court, in the second PILs, restrained the Government of Gujarat from granting any more authorization and permission for laying down any pipeline in any part of the sanctuary or the national park. As a result of this order, Essar was not given permission to lay down pipelines by the State Government.
37. Being aggrieved, inter alia, on the ground that it was not a party to the second PILs, Essar filed a review/recall application before the High Court being MCA No. 250 of 2011 in SCA No. 1778 of 2000, inter alia, seeking review and recall of the judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 passed in the second PILs by the High Court and a further declaration to the effect that Essar's project at Vadinar was not affected in any manner by the said judgment.
38. By judgment and order dated 23.02.2001 the High Court rejected the said application for review on the ground that there was a factual controversy between Essar and the State Government and that therefore the grievance of Essar was beyond the scope of review.
39. Meanwhile, on 12.04.2001 the Government of Gujarat extended the time for going into commercial production upto 15.08.2003 for various pipeline units including Essar, vide Government Resolution dated 12.04.2001. By that time Essar had obtained Provisional Premier Unit Registration before 15.08.2000 and had also incurred 25% of the Project Cost before 15.08.2000 and therefore, it was entitled to the benefit of this extension.
40. Essar challenged the aforesaid judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000, 03.08.2000 and 23.02.2001 of the High Court delivered in the second PILs and the rejection of its review petition in that second PILs respectively by way of filing Special Level Petition being (SLP) CC No. 3654 of 2001 (later SLP No. 94549455 of 2001) before this Hon'ble Court.
41. By interim order-dated 11.05.2001 this Court granted stay of the judgment of the High Court in so far as Essar was concerned in SLP No. 9454-9455 of 2001 i.e. SLP filed by Essar. The text of the order of this Court is set out:
Permission to file Special Leave Petition is granted.
Issue notice.
Stay of the High Court judgment in so far as the Petitioner is concerned.
Counter affidavit be filed within four weeks. Rejoinder be filed within four weeks thereafter. List after eight weeks.
42. In view of the above stay order granted by this Court, Essar moved the State Government for permitting it to proceed with the construction of jetty and laying the pipeline. By letter dated 29.10.2001, the State Government in the Forests and Environment Department specifically called Essar to ensure that no construction activities were commenced before obtaining all necessary clearances from different Government departments, agencies and the conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India as well as the Forests and Environment Department of the State Government were strictly complied with. However, Essar did not commence the construction of jetty or laying down the pipeline in the National Marine Park/Sanctuary area. One thing which is of some importance is that despite the stay of this Court and the Government letter dated 29.10.2001, Essar did not challenge the Government stand in the pending special leave petition filed by it in this Court.
43. It is also pertinent to note that the Government of Gujarat had also challenged the judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 of the High Court passed in the second PILs by way of filing Special Leave Petition being (SLP) CC No. 5123-5125 of 2001 (later SLP No. 17694-96 of 2001) before this Court, wherein by interim order dated 24.09.2001 this Court passed the following operative order:
Issue notice.
Tag with SLP(C) 9454-9455/2001.
There will be status quo as of today with the result that any permission which has been granted is not stayed. It will be open to the State Government to consider the granting of further permission which will be subject to the outcome of this appeal.
44. Essar just requested by its letter dated 11.04.2002 the Industries Commissioner to extend the date of commercial production to 30.11.2004 instead of 15.08.2003 for the purpose of availing the incentive benefit under the Scheme and cited that the delay in completing the project and consequent delay in starting commercial production was due to the factors beyond the control of Essar. Further by letter-dated 07.05.2002 Essar in continuation of the letter-dated 11.04.2002 requested the Industries Commissioner to extend the date of commercial production to August 2006.
45. The Industries Commissioner refused to grant any further extension of time vide its letter-dated 28.05.2002 and also made it clear to Essar to go into commercial production within the specified time i.e. till 15.08.2003. Essar, therefore, submitted a representation dated 19.06.2002 to the Chief Minister pointing out the circumstances which had delayed the completion of the project. Similar representations were thereafter made to different authorities of the State Government on 27.06.2002, 14.03.2003, 30.07.2003, 02.12.2003 and 26.12.2003. It appears that the said representations were not responded to.
46. By an order-dated 19.01.2004, this Court quashed and set aside the judgment dated 03.08.2000 of High Court and directed the State Government to issue the authorization to Essar in the requisite format under Sections 29 and 35 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act within a fortnight after disapproving the interpretation placed by the High Court on the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. This Court took the view that the permission granted by the State Government on 16.10.1997 was the permission contemplated by Section 29 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act.
47. In compliance with the above judgment, by letter dated 12.02.2004, the State Government authorized the Chief Wild Life Warden, Gujarat State under Sections 29 and 35 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act to permit Essar for laying oil pipeline in the National Marine Park/Sanctuary area. The Chief Wild Life Warden also issued the requisite permission on 27.02.2004.
48. In the meantime, the accused i.e. officials and contractors of Essar involved in the Criminal Case of 1999 moved an application for discharge before the Metropolitan Magistrate at Khambalia. By order- dated 27.05.2004 the Magistrate allowed the said application and discharged the accused persons from all the charges levelled against them.
49. In view of the above permission granted by the Chief Wild Life Warden under Sections 29 and 35 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, Essar again sent representations dated 06.04.2004, 12.07.2004, 27.07.2004 and 22.12.2004 to the Government requesting extension of time limit for commencement of commercial production for the purpose of sales tax deferment incentive scheme. In view of the above representations, the State Government in the Industries and Mines Department vide Resolution dated 10.05.2006 constituted a Committee comprising of the Advisor to the Chief Minister, the then Additional Chief Secretary, Finance Department and the then Principal Secretary, Industries and Mines department. The Committee was constituted to consider various such representations of Essar and other Companies.
50. On 26.11.2006 Essar commenced commercial production and started paying sales tax on the products sold by it, under protest.
51. As nothing was heard from the said Committee constituted in the year 2006 and the representations made by Essar in respect of granting Sales Tax Deferment were undecided, Essar filed a writ petition being Special Civil Application No. 24233/2007 before the High Court contending that for no fault of it, Essar was prevented from completing the project and that it was on account of being so prevented, Essar could not commence the commercial production within the time limit of 15.08.2003.
52. It is pertinent to note at this stage that before the High Court, Essar had expressly withdrawn the allegation that Department of Forest and Conservation, Government of Gujarat was guilty of delay. This is noted in para 6.2 of the High Court judgment which is set out below:
6.2 While in the memo of the petition some allegations/submissions have been made attributing the delay to the Forests and Conservation Department of State Government, but the Petitioner Company is not interested in pursuing those allegations and in fact would like to withdraw those allegations and the Petitioner would like to invoke the following maxims of equity:
(i) "An act of the Court shall prejudice no man", and
(ii) "The law does not compel a man to do that which he cannot possibly perform.
53. Before the High Court Essar contended that reason for delay in commencement of commercial production was on account of the injunction granted by the High Court on 13.07.2000/03.08.2000, restraining the State from granting further permission under Section 29 of the WPA in the second PILs (where Essar was not a party). and this situation continued till 27.02.2004, when pursuant to the judgment-dated 19.01.2004 of this Court the Chief Warden granted the said permission. Therefore Essar was entitled to get benefit of the exclusion of the said intervening period of from 13.07.2000 to 27.02.2004 i.e. three years and 230 days in calculating the time limit for commencement of commercial production.
54. By impugned order-dated 22.04.2008 the High Court excluded the aforesaid intervening period and as such extended the time limit for commencement of commercial production from 15.08.2003 to 02.04.2007 after observing in the impugned judgment as under:
17. ...In the facts of the present case also, the State Government had granted the permission on 16.10.1997 and the Central Government had granted the permission on 08.12.1999. The very fact that the Chief Wild Life Warden issued the permission on 27.02.2004 after the decision of the Apex Court on 19.01.2004 is itself sufficient to show that the request made by the petitioner for excluding the intervening period between 13th July/3rd August, 2000 and 27.02.2004 is reasonable.
55. It is also pertinent to note herein that in the impugned order, a direction was given to the State Government that while considering Essar's application for the incentives, the State Government shall stipulate the following conditions, provided the final eligibility certificate is issued within one month from the date of receipt of the judgment:
22. ...
(i) The Petitioner shall not be given the benefit of deferment of Sales-tax/Value Added Tax beyond 14th August, 2020.
(ii) The amount of Sales-tax/VAT already paid/payable by the Petitioner for the period upto today shall not be refunded to the Petitioner.
(The above amount is stated by the Petitioner company to be above Rs. 300 crores)
(iii) Without adjusting the Sales-tax/VAT paid for the period upto today as aforesaid, the amount otherwise computable under the Incentive Scheme on the basis of the eligible capital investment made by the Petitioner in the unit under consideration shall be reduced by Rs. 700 crores.
56. The above direction is based on the submissions of the counsel of both the parties, which were made without prejudice to their respective cases. The counsel of Essar submitted a proposal that Essar was ready to make the above mentioned concessions No. (i) & (ii) if the State Government does not challenge the decision of the High Court and within one month from that day the State Government grants Essar the benefit of the Sales Tax/VAT deferment as per the said scheme. In response to the said proposal the learned counsel for the State Government replied that assuming that Essar was found to be eligible under the said Scheme, the amount otherwise computable under the Incentive Scheme on the basis of the eligible capital investment made by Essar in the unit under consideration shall be reduced by Rs. 700 crores.
57. The learned counsel for the Respondents made an attempt to urge that the judgment of the High Court was virtually rendered by way of a concession and the impugned judgment is a consent order. As such the appeal, at the instance of the State, is not maintainable. Learned Counsel for the State strongly opposed this contention and submitted that the same contention was raised at the time of admission of the special leave petition. Then, further affidavit was filed by the State with the leave of the Court. The Court was satisfied and then issued notice.
58. Ultimately, the matter was argued on merits before this Court and it was common ground that the impugned judgment is not by consent.
59. The impugned judgment of the High Court is based on two basic line of reasoning that the Respondents are entitled to the benefit of Sales Tax Waiver Scheme firstly on the principle of restitution and secondly, that the Respondents cannot be made to lose the benefit under the Sales Tax Waiver Scheme, for an act of Court. In this regard it has been urged that the Respondents could not set up the plant for the purpose of commercial production within 15th August, 2003 as it was prevented from doing so by an order of injunction of the High Court. An order of injunction is an act of Court and an act of High Court cannot prejudice anyone. The loss of time suffered by the Respondent as a result of the injunction order cannot cause any prejudice to the Respondent.
60. Examining the aforesaid two contentions, this Court finds that there is an overlapping area between the two. The concept of restitution is basically founded on the idea that when a decree is reversed, law imposes an obligation on the party who received an unjust benefit of the erroneous decree to restitute the other party for what the other party has lost during the period the erroneous decree was in operation. Therefore, the Court while granting restitution is required to restore the parties as far as possible to their same position as they were in at the time when the Court by its erroneous action displaced them. In the case of Lal Bhagwant Singh v. Sri Kishen Das reported in MANU/SC/0071/1953 : AIR 1953 SC 136, Justice Mahajan speaking for a unanimous three-Judge Bench of this Court explained the doctrine of restitution in the following words:
...the principles of the doctrine of restitution which is that on the reversal of a judgment the law raises an obligation on the party to the record who received the benefit of the erroneous judgment to make restitution to the other party for what he had lost and that it is the duty of the Court to enforce that obligation unless it is shown that restitution would be clearly contrary to the real justice of the case...
