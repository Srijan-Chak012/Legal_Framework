Case Note:
Environment - Scope of Suo Moto Jurisdiction - National Green Tribunal (NGT) - Discharge of functions under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (NGT Act) - Deonar Dumping site - Non-compliance of provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 - Whether the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has the power to exercise SuoMotu jurisdiction in discharge of its functions under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (NGT Act)

Facts:

In the Suo Moto action by NGT pursuant to published article about damage to the environment and public health being cause by dumping site in non-compliance of solid waste rules. Steps were taken for inspection of the concerned site. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) was asked to compensate to the tune of Rs. 5 crores. Power of NGT being Tribunal was questioned as to whether in such capacity NGT can take action SuoMotu or has the power of judicial review.

Held, while dismissing the Appeal:

i.The NGT Act, when read as a whole, gives much leeway to the NGT to go beyond a mere adjudicatory role. The Parliament's intention is clearly discernible to create a multifunctional body, with the capacity to provide redressal for environmental exigencies. Accordingly, the principles of environmental justice and environmental equity must be explicitly acknowledged as pivotal threads of the NGT's fabric.[30]

ii.In circumstances where adverse environmental impact may be egregious, but the community affected is unable to effectively get the machinery into action, a forum created specifically to address such concerns should surely be expected to move with expediency, and of its own accord.[34]

iii.The NGT, with the distinct role envisaged for it, can hardly afford to remain a mute spectator when no-one knocks on its door. The forum itself has correctly identified the need for collective stratagem for addressing environmental concerns. [35]

iv.When the Registry of the NGT does indeed receive a communication or letter, including matters published in media, it may cause to initiate suomotu action by inviting attention of NGT to such matters in the form of office report. Such circumstances would however require a notice to be given to the sender of the communication or author of the news item, as the case may be, to assist the NGT in the course of hearing and to substantiate the factual matters. It must also be said that the exercise of suomotu jurisdiction does not mean eschewing with the principles of natural justice and fair play. In other words, the party likely to be affected should be afforded due opportunity to present their side, before suffering adverse orders.[37]

v.The NGT is vested with suomotu power in discharge of its functions under the NGT Act.[40]

JUDGMENT
Hrishikesh Roy, J.
Estragon: Let's go.
Vladimir: We can't.
Estragon: Why not?
Vladimir: We're waiting for Godot.1
1. Leave granted in the Special Leave Petitions.
2. The consideration to be made in these matters is whether the National Green Tribunal (for short "the NGT") has the power to exercise Suo Motu jurisdiction in discharge of its functions under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (for short, "the NGT Act 2010").
3. In the lead case in this group, i.e. the Civil Appeal No. 86 of 2019, the NGT noticed an Article titled "Garbage Gangs of Deonar: The Kingpins and Their Multi-Crore Trade" in the online news portal, The Quint. The Article spoke of how mismanagement of solid waste had an adverse impact on the environment, public health and lives of individuals living in the vicinity of the dumping ground in Mumbai city.
4. The NGT took suo motu cognizance of the above Article vide order dated 07.08.2018 and directed that the Article writer Ankita Sinha be the Applicant in the case OA No. 510 of 2018, registered at the NGT's instance. Thereafter, steps were taken for inspection of the Deonar Dumping site by the representative of the Central Pollution Control Board, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the District Collector of the area and also the representative of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (for short "the MCGM"). Pursuant to the Report of the inspecting team which highlighted that the landfill site failed to comply with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the NGT vide order dated 30.10.2018 noted that 'damage to the environment and public health is self-evident' and ordered MCGM to pay compensation to the tune of Rs. 5 crores.
5. This Court while entertaining the Civil Appeal No. 86/2019 of MCGM, ordered stay on the operation of the order passed by the NGT and thereafter arranged for analogous consideration of the related cases where the common threshold jurisdictional issue arises on whether the NGT has the power to exercise suo motu jurisdiction.
6. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Mr. Jaideep Gupta, Mr. Dhruv Mehta, Mr. Atmaram Nadkarni, Mr. Krishnan Venugopal, Mr. V. Giri, Mr. Sajan Poovayya and Mr. Sidhartha Dave, learned Senior Counsel together with Mr. E.M.S Anam, Ms. Amrita Sharma, Mr. S. Thananjayan have taken a common stand. They have argued that the NGT is a Tribunal and a creature of statute and as such, it cannot act on its own motion or exercise the power of judicial review or act suo motu, in discharge of its function. Being a creature of the statute, the forum cannot assume inherent powers as Under Article 32 and Article 226 and its domain is circumscribed by the limitations so imposed. The learned Counsel also argue that the NGT has an adjudicatory role to decide disputes which necessarily mean involvement of two or more contesting parties. Therefore, the NGT by acting suo motu cannot transpose itself to the shoes of one such party. The absence of general power of judicial review with the NGT (which is available with superior courts) is highlighted to keep away suo motu power from the NGT. Various judgments relating to the Tribunal's power and role are cited by the counsel and those would be discussed in later part of this order.
7. Projecting the contrary view, Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the aggrieved party in SLP(C) No. 6732/2021, Mr. Sanjay Parikh, learned Senior Counsel for the Intervener in C.A. No. 86/2019 and Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Impleader I.A. No. 71482/2021 in the SLP(C) No. 6732/2021, by referring to the special role envisaged for the NGT and the history of its incorporation, make equally powerful submission in support of exercise of suo motu jurisdiction, by the NGT.
8. Mr. Anand Grover, the learned Senior Counsel was appointed as the Amicus Curiae to assist the Court and he was heard at length. The counsel acknowledges the NGT's role and position under the Act and its wide jurisdiction over environmental matters but Mr. Grover is of the view that the NGT is incapable of triggering action on its own. In other words, the NGT cannot act suo motu without someone moving the Forum as otherwise the forum then would be perceived to be judging its own cause. Since suo motu power is not conferred under the NGT Act, the specialized tribunal has to be moved by an outside party. But the format of the application is not important and even a letter addressed by an interested party, will clothe the NGT with power to take action is the concessional submission of Mr. Grover.
9. Representing the Central Government, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India submitted that Suo Motu power is not exercisable by the NGT since the same has not been conferred on the forum under the NGT Act, unlike the situation in the now repealed National Environment Tribunal Act, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the "NET Act"). The counsel refers to the provisions of the NGT Act and submits that the concept of locus standi was expanded for NGT's intervention Under Section 18(2)(e) but the tribunal is not vested with suo motu power to take action on its own unlike the High Courts and the Supreme Court. The learned ASG, however, submits that even on receipt of a letter, the NGT can commence action on environmental matters. Thus, on exercise of epistolary jurisdiction by the NGT, the ASG is on the same page as the amicus curiae but as earlier noted both counsel argue for keeping away the suo motu power from the NGT.
10.1. Having summarized the positions taken by the respective Counsel, we may now refer to the specific grounds of challenge to keep away suo motu power from the NGT. The concerned counsel project that NGT is a creature of the statute and just like other such statutory tribunals, the NGT is also bound within statutory confines. They have relied upon Standard Chartered v. Dharminder Bhohi MANU/SC/1004/2013 : (2013) 15 SCC 341 wherein, provisions of the Recovery of the Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 were analysed to note the limitations of the Debt Recovery Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal. From the analysis of Justice Dipak Misra (as his Lordship then was) for the Division Bench, it can be inferred that the Tribunal was given power under the statute to pass such other orders and give such directions to give effect to its orders or to prevent abuse of its process or to secure the ends of justice but in discharge of its functions the Tribunal wasrequired to confine itself to within the statutory parameters. Thus, Section 19(25) conferred limited powers and the submission thus is that the Tribunal does not have any inherent powers.
10.2. Similarly, Justice S.H. Kapadia (as his Lordship then was) in Transcore v. Union of India MANU/SC/5319/2006 : (2008) 1 SCC 125, opined on behalf of a Division Bench that,
67. ...The DRT is a tribunal, it is the creature of the statute, it has no inherent power which exists in the civil courts.
