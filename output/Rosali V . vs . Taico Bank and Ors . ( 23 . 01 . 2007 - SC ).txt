JUDGMENT
S.B. Sinha, J.
1. A judgment and order dated 8.01.1999 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in CRP No. 3528 of 1998 is in question before us, which arises in the following factual matrix.
2. M/s. Nellai Small Match Producers Service Industrial Co-op. Society Ltd. filed a suit against N. Dharmaraj, Respondent No. 2 herein in the Court of Principal Subordinate Judge in the State of Tamil Nadu for realization of some amount owing and due to it. The said suit was decreed. The said decree was transferred for execution to the Court of City Civil Judge, Bangalore. The matter ultimately was transferred to the Court of the 17th Additional City Civil Judge, Bangalore. A proclamation of sale of immovable property bearing No. 1138/8, II Main Road, Vijaynagar, Bangalore was issued on 21.10.1988 whereupon the auction sale was held. In the said auction sale Smt. Mahadevi S. Havannavar became the highest bidder having given a bid for a sum of Rs. 3,25,000/-. The said deal was accepted by the learned Executing Court on 26.10.1988. It is stated that the said sale was conducted at about 4.00 p.m. on the said date and keeping in view of the fact that the banks at that time were closed, the court directed the auction purchaser to deposit the amount by the next day in the following terms:
Sale proclamation and warrant not served at spot. TRD files vakalath for the bidder did accepted (sic), permitted to deposit 25% of the sale amount by tomorrow. Property is free from encumbrances as it stands for balance of consideration by 11.11.
It is not in dispute that pursuant to or in furtherance of the said direction, the auction purchaser deposited the amount of 25% of the sale amount on 27.10.1988 and deposited the balance amount on 11.11.1988.
3. Smt. Leelavathi, Respondent No. 3 herein, in the meanwhile, had instituted a suit in the Court of Addl. City Civil Judge Bangalore being O.S. No. 2493 of 1981 on 17.08.1981 for specific performance of contract against Respondent No. 2 in respect of the self-same property where for a sum of Rs. 1,05,000/- said to have been paid by way of advance. The said suit was decreed by the said Civil Judge by a judgment and order dated 20.04.1985. An appeal was preferred there against before the High Court which was dismissed by an order dated 6/8.03.1996.
4. After the auction sale was confirmed, Respondent No. 3 appears to have filed an application purported to be under Order XXI Rule 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code). It is not in dispute that by an order dated 11.11.1988 as no objection was filed and the entire amount had been deposited, the sale was confirmed and the sale certificate was directed to be issued to the auction purchaser. Sale certificate on a stamp paper, which had been furnished in the meanwhile, was issued by the Court on 17.11.1988.
5. It is also stated that the property in question had been allotted by the Bangalore Development Authority to the original owner. The Bangalore Development Authority by a registered deed of sale dated 16.01.1990 transferred the property in favour of Shri Sangamesh G. Havannavar, husband of the auction purchaser Smt. Mahadevi S. Havannavar as in the meantime she had died. On or about 5.02.1992, the said Shri Sangamesh G. Havannavar transferred his right, title and interest in the said property in favour of the appellant herein in terms of a registered deed of sale dated 5.02.1992.
It is contended that the appellant obtained licence from the appropriate authority for renovation of the existing ground floor and for construction of the first floor and pursuant to grant of sanction in this behalf had made constructions upon incurring a cost of Rs. 8,00,000/- therefore. He is said to have been residing therein.
6. Appellant herein was not impleaded as a party in the said execution proceedings. Respondent No. 3, however, obtained warrant of delivery of possession of the said property in execution of the decree of specific performance passed in her favour. On or about 01.08.1998, the appellant obstructed in taking possession pursuant to the said warrant of delivery of possession and eventually filed an application under Order XXI Rule 97, 98, 100 and 101 of the Code. From the objection filed by Respondent No. 3, it transpired that the auction sale had allegedly been set aside at the instance of the decree holder on the premise that the sale was void as it was confirmed before expiry of 30 days from the date of acceptance of the bid and other litigations by an order dated 27.09.1996 which is to the following effect:
Dhr. KAB
Jdr. SGK
To hear Dhr. and to produce copy of orders in RFA.
Sri MRG for Dhr submits that the sale is void in view of the confirmation before 30 days and other litigations. Hence sale is set aside for these reasons.
The said order appears to be vague. No reason has been assigned in support thereof. On what ground the decree holder was permitted to raise the said contention was not disclosed.
7. A revision application was filed by the appellant herein before the High Court which by reason of the impugned judgment has been dismissed. It appears that the vendor of the appellant had also filed a revision application and the same was also disposed of by reason of the said judgment the High Court in its impugned judgment, however, opined that in view of the fact that the 25% of the bid amount was not deposited on 26.10.1988 and was deposited on 27.10.1988, the provision of Order XXI Rule 84 was not complied with and in that view of the matter the auction sale was bad in law. For arriving at the said finding, reliance was placed upon a decision of this Court in Manilal Mohanlal Shah and Ors. v. Sardar Sayed Ahmed Sayed Mahamad and Anr. MANU/SC/0005/1954 : [1955]1SCR108 .
8. Mr. T.L. Viswanath Iyer, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that the predecessor of the appellant having deposited the 25% amount on 27.10.1988 pursuant to or in furtherance of the order passed by the learned Judge himself, the same cannot be said to be in contravention of the provisions of Order XXI Rule 84 of the Code. It was submitted that had an opportunity of hearing been given to the appellant, he could have shown that the bid having been accepted at 4 O'Clock, there was no other way to deposit the 25% of the bid amount in the bank and only with a view to obviate the same, the learned Judge directed the auction purchaser to deposit the said amount on the next day. Mr. Iyer would urge that, in any event, non-compliance of Order XXI Rule 84 of the Code having not been raised by the decree holder, the High Court committed a manifest error in relying thereupon as also the decision of this Court in Manilal Mohanlal Shah (supra).
Mr. S.S. Javali, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, however, would submit that the judgment debtor and Respondent No. 2 herein had colluded with the auction purchaser with a view to defeat the decree of specific performance of contract. The learned counsel argued that in the first appeal preferred by Respondent No. 2 against the judgment and decree dated 20.04.1985 passed in favour of Respondent No. 3, Respondent No. 2 had undertaken not to sell or transfer the said property. The learned Counsel contended that the auction sale being mala fide, this Court should not interfere with the impugned judgment.
9. In view of the rival contentions of the parties, as noticed hereinbefore, the questions which would arise for our consideration are:
(i) What would be the meaning of the term "immediately" occurring in Order XXI Rule 84 of the Code, in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case?
(ii) Whether the sale was void only because it was confirmed before expiry of the period of 30 days.
10. Order XXI Rule 84(1) of the Code reads as under:
84. Deposit by purchaser and re-sale on default.-- (1) On every sale of immovable properly the person declared to be the purchaser shall pay immediately after such declaration a deposit of twenty-five per cent on the amount of his purchase-money to the officer or other person conducting the sale, and in default of such deposit, the property shall forthwith be re-sold.
11. What would be the meaning of the term "immediately" came up for consideration before this Court, as noticed hereinbefore, in Manilal Mohanlal Shah (supra) wherein it was held:
Having examined the language of the relevant rules and the judicial decisions bearing upon the subject we are of opinion that the provisions of the rules requiring the deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase-money immediately on the person being declared as a purchaser and the payment of the balance within 15 days of the sale are mandatory and upon non-compliance with these provisions there is no sale at all. The rules do not contemplate that there can be any sale in favour of a purchaser without depositing 25 per cent of the purchase- money in the first instance and the balance within 15 days. When there is no sale within the contemplation of these rules, there can be no question of material irregularity in the conduct of the sale. Non-payment of the price on the part of the defaulting purchaser renders the sale proceedings as a complete nullity. The very fact that the Court is bound to re-sell the property in the event of a default shows that the previous proceedings for sale are completely wiped out as if they do not exist in the eye of law. We hold, therefore, that in the circumstances of the present case there was no sale and the purchasers acquired no rights at all.
