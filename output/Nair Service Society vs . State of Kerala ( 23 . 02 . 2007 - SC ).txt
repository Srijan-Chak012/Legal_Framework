Case Note:
(1)Constitution of India - Articles 14 and 16-Employment-Reservation for other backward classes (O.B.C.)-Identification of creamy layer as per direction in Indra Sawhney 1, 1992 Supp. (3) SCC 217-State of Kerala did not comply with said directions-State of Kerala passed enactment declaring that there was no socially advanced section in State-On request of Supreme Court. Chief Justice of Kerala High Court constituted committee headed by Justice K. J. Joseph (Joseph Committee)-Committee submitted report to Supreme Court-Supreme Court while holding provisions of Sections 3, 4 and 6 of Kerala Act as unconstitutional, accepted report of Joseph Committee in toto subject to certain additions of communities-But recommendations of Joseph Committee not implemented by State forthwith-State rather appointed another Commission headed by Justice K. K. Narendran-Commission submitted its report-Whether report of Narendran Commission liable to be set aside?-Held, "yes"-No justification for fixing income limit of Rs. 3 lakhs for creamy layer-Criticism by Narendran Commission of Joseph Committee-Wholly unwarranted-Findings of Commission should have been based on scientific data as also evidence of experts-While determining issue whether persons having obtained economic sufficiency, so as not to furthermore describe them as economically backward-Required to be taken into consideration-Report of Narendran Commission set aside-State to appoint fresh Commission.

(2)Constitution of India - Articles 14 and 16-Employment-Reservation for O.B.C.-Determination of creamy layer-Is part of constitutional scheme.

(3)Constitution of India - Articles 14 and 16-Employment-Reservation for O.B.C.-Creamy layer doctrine evolved by Supreme Court-Group of persons although not backward or having by passage of time ceased to be backward-Would come within purview of creamy layer doctrine.
Ratio Decidendi:
"Despite Article 38 of the Constitution of India, the Courts are bound to interpret a law which seeks to achieve the said purpose not only on the anvil of the Articles 14 and 16 but also having regard to the International law."

SERVICE MATTERS - RESERVATION IN SERVICE FOR SC/ST/OBC
JUDGMENT
S.B. Sinha, J.
1. In these petitions, interpretation of this Court's judgment as regards identification of 'creamy layer' amongst the backward classes and their exclusion from the purview of reservation, vis-Ã -vis, the report of Justice K.K. Narendran Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'Narendran Commission') and acceptance thereof by the State of Kerala in issuing the impugned notification dated 27.5.2000, falls for our consideration in this writ petition by the Nair Service Society ('the Society'), a Society which was initially registered under Section 26 of the Travancore Companies Act, 1914 and after coming into force the Companies Act, 1956, it would be deemed to have been registered under Section 25 thereof. The objects of the Society are said to be:
(i) to remove the difference prevailing from places to places amongst Nairs in their social customs and usages as well as the unhealthy practices prevalent among them;
(ii) to participate in the efforts of other communities for the betterment of their lot and to maintain and foster communal amity;
(iii) to work for the uplift of the depressed classes;
(iv) to start and maintain such institutions as are found necessary to promote the objects of the society.
It is not in dispute that it had filed a writ petition before the Kerala High Court questioning the validity of the report commonly known as Mandal Commission Report. The writ petition was later on transferred to this Court. It also took part in the proceedings before Narendran Commission. Mandal Commission Report was accepted by Union of India.
2. A writ petition was filed before this Court, questioning the said action on the part of the Union of India by one Indra Sawhney. This Court, in its judgment in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0104/1993 (hereinafter referred to as 'Indra Sawhney-I'), inter alia, directed the States to identify 'creamy layer' amongst the backward classes and exclude them from the purview of reservation. Indisputably, pursuant to or in furtherance of the said directions, the Union of India appointed a Commission. It issued an Office Memorandum being dated September 8, 1993 laying down guidelines for identifying 'creamy layer', inter alia, stipulating that the sons and daughters of persons having gross annual income of Rs.1 lakh or above would be excluded. The State of Kerala, it is not in dispute, did not comply with the said direction of this Court.
3. At this juncture, it may be noticed that the constitutional validity of the criteria for determining the 'creamy layer' for the purpose of exclusion from backward classes laid down by the States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh came up for consideration before this Court in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar and Ors. MANU/SC/0011/1996 : AIR1996SC75 . This Court held that having regard to the observations made in Indra Sawhney-I, the said criteria were ultra vires stating:
This Court in Mandal case [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India MANU/SC/0104/1993 : (1992) Supp.3 SCC 217 has clearly and authoritatively laid down that the affluent part of a backward class called "creamy layer" has to be excluded from the said class and the benefit of Article 16(4) can only be given to the 'class' which remains after the exclusion of the "creamy layer". The backward class under Article 16(4)means the class which has no element of "creamy layer" in it. It is mandatory under Article 16(4) - as interpreted by this Court - that the State must identify the "creamy layer" in a backward class and thereafter by excluding the "creamy layer" extend the benefit of reservation to the 'class' which remains after such exclusion. This Court has laid down, clear and easy to follow, guidelines for the identification of "creamy layer". The States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have acted wholly arbitrary and in utter violation of the law laid down by this Court in Mandal case....
