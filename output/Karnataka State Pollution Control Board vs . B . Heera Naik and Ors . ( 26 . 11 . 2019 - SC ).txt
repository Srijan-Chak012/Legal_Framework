Case Note:
Criminal - Body corporate - Prosecution thereof - Sections 4,43,44,47,48 and 49 of Water Act, 1974 - State Pollution Control Board filed complaint in Court of Metropolitan Magistrate praying for taking cognizance of offence punishable under Sections 43 and 44 of Act, 1974 against Accused persons - In complaint, City Municipal Council was impleaded as Accused No. 1 and Respondent No. 2 was Commissioner of City Municipal Council and Respondent Nos. 3 to 7 were all Ex-Commissioners - Respondents filed criminal petitions to quash the entire proceeding initiated by Appellant for prosecution of Respondents under Act, 1974 - Single Judge of High Court quashed proceedings initiated by Appellant - Hence, present appeal - Whether Commissioner of City Municipal Council and Chief Officers of City Municipal Council could be prosecuted under Section 48 of Act.

Facts:

The State Pollution Control Board filed a complaint in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate praying for taking cognizance of the offence punishable under Sections 43 and 44 of the Act, 1974 against the Accused persons and to punish them for the offences. In the complaint, the City Municipal Council, was impleaded as Accused No. 1 and Respondent No. 2 was the Commissioner of the City Municipal Council and Respondent Nos. 3 to 7 were all Ex-Commissioners. The Respondents to these appeals filed criminal petitions under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure praying to quash the entire proceeding initiated by Appellant for prosecution of the Respondents under the Act, 1974. The Single Judge of the High Court allowed all the three applications filed under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure quashing the proceedings initiated by the Appellant.

Held, while allowing the appeal:

(i) The Scheme of the Act as delineated by Section 4 of Act indicate that there are separate members to represent the Government in the Board, separate members to represent the local authorities functioning in the State and separate members to represent the companies or corporations owned, controlled or managed by the State Government. The Government, local authorities and companies or corporations owned, controlled or managed by the State Government were all different expressions used in the Act. Whether an institution was a corporation or a Department of the Government has to be found out from the Scheme under which it had been created. One of the tests to find out as to whether an institution was a Corporation or a Department of the Government was to enquire whether the undertaking functions as a responsible independent organisation and not as part of any Department of the State. Second test would be to see whether it was endowed with the capacity to contract obligations and of suing and being sued. Further, the power to possess, use and change a seal was incidental to a corporation and a corporation aggregate could, as a general rule, only act or express its would by deed under its common seal. The Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 provides for a Town and City Municipal Councils as a body corporate. The control of the State Government on the Municipality was provided in a separate chapter, i.e., Chapter XII. The Scheme of constitution of Municipal area and other provisions of Act, 1964 clearly indicate that Municipalities were not a Department of the Government. [15]

(ii) In a Statute, the definition of an expression has to be found out in accordance with the context and Scheme of the enactment. The definition of company is contained in the Companies Act, 1956 in Section 3. The definition of company as contained in the Companies Act, 1956 was clearly not borrowed in the expression of company as used in Section 47 of Act, 1974. The company had been defined in Section 47 of Act, 1974 in a very wide and inclusive manner. Explanation states that company means any body corporate. Thus, all body corporates were included within the definition of company as per Section 47 of Act. There could not be any dispute that City Municipal Council was a body corporate, which had been clearly provided under Section 10 of Act, 1964. [20]

(iii) Thus, looking to the purpose and object of Act, 1974, this court were of the opinion that Section 47 could be resorted to for offences by body corporate and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board by filing a complaint before the Magistrate for taking cognizance of offence under Section 49 did not commit an error. [29]

(iv) Section 49 embraces cognizance of all offences under the Act. Whether the offences were covered by Section 47 or 48 had no bearing on the power of the Court to take cognizance of an offence. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has filed complaint for taking cognizance specifically referring to Section 49 of the Act, 1974. Thus, in event any offence was committed by anyone, its cognizance could be taken under Section 49 of Act. However, reiterate that offences by a body corporate were to be covered by Section 47, since in event offences by body corporates were not covered by Section 47, the benefit of Section 47(1) proviso shall not be available to those body corporates, which cannot be the intention of the Legislature. Thus, conclude that offences by body corporate like City Municipal Council were covered under Section 49 treating it to be offence as by company as provided in Section 47 of Act. [31]
Disposition:
Application Dismissed
JUDGMENT
Ashok Bhushan, J.
1. These appeals raise an important question as to whether Commissioner of City Municipal Council and Chief Officers of City Municipal Council can be prosecuted Under Section 48 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as "Act, 1974"). By these appeals, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has challenged the judgment of High Court of Karnataka dated 16.02.2015 by which applications Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure filed by the Respondents, who were working as Municipal Commissioner and Chief Officers of Municipal Council, were allowed and the proceeding initiated for their prosecution by Appellant under the Act, 1974 has been quashed.
2. The High Court vide impugned judgment dated 16.02.2015 has allowed three separate applications Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure being Criminal Petition Nos. 2627 of 2012, 1537 of 2011 and 1010 of 2011. All the three applications were filed on the basis of similar facts. It is sufficient to refer to the facts in Criminal Petition No. 2627 of 2012 filed in the High Court, for deciding these appeals.
3. The brief facts necessary to be noticed for deciding these appeals are:
3.1 The Appellant Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is a statutory body established Under Section 4 of the Act, 1974. The Board is a body corporate having perpetuate succession and common seal. The Act, 1974 provides for special procedure for taking cognizance of the offence punishable under the Act, 1974.
3.2 First Respondent to the appeal is Shri B. Heera Naik, who was working as the Commissioner, City Municipal Council, Krishnarajapuram, Bangalore. The second Respondent M.A. Baig and the third Respondent D.L. Narayan were also Ex-Commissioner of City Municipal Council, Krishnarajapuram, Bangalore.
3.3 The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board filed a complaint being C.C. No. 1101 of 2006 in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate at Bangalore praying for taking cognizance of the offence punishable Under Sections 43 and 44 of the Act, 1974 against the Accused persons and to punish them for the offences. In the complaint, the City Municipal Council, Krishnarajapuram, Bangalore was impleaded as Accused No. 1 and Respondent No. 2 was the Commissioner of the City Municipal Council and Respondent Nos. 3 to 7 were all Ex-Commissioners, who had held the office of Commissioner from different periods from 03.11.2004 till the date of filing of complaint. The complaint stated that Board had accorded a consent to the Accused persons to discharge sewage effluent after treatment which was expired on 30.06.2006 and thereafter the same has not been renewed. One of the conditions of the said consent was that the Accused persons should provide Sewage Treatment Plant within six months to treat sewage generated in the City Municipal Council Area which has not been done so far, nor any steps have been taken in that regard, and on the other hand, the Accused persons have continuously discharging the untreated sewage into the water bodies like ponds, lakes, natural valleys. The Complaint stated that non-obtaining of the consent after 30.06.2006, non-providing of Sewage Treatment Plant, Under Ground Drainage facility and discharging the untreated sewage into the neighbouring water bodies constitute the violation of Section 25 of the Act, 1974, which is punishable Under Section 44 of the Act, 1974.
3.4 Similar complaints were filed by Karnataka State Pollution Control Board with regard to the Town Municipal Council, Kengeri, Bangalore and the Chief Officer of the Town Municipal Council as well as complaint against City Municipal Council, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Mysore Road and its Commissioner.
3.5 The Respondents to these appeals filed criminal petitions Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure praying to quash the entire proceeding initiated by Appellant for prosecution of the Respondents under the Act, 1974.
3.6 The learned Single Judge of the High Court vide its judgment dated 16.02.2015 allowed all the three applications filed Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure quashing the proceedings initiated by the Appellant following an earlier judgment of Karnataka High Court dated 18.01.2012 in Criminal Petition No. 831 of 2007, which in turn had relied on a Division Bench judgment of the Karnataka High Court in Writ Petition No. 30610 of 2008. The Division Bench had held that Commissioner of Municipal Council, Chief Officer or Council cannot be termed as Head of the Department and they cannot be prosecuted Under Section 48 of the Act, 1974. Aggrieved against the judgment of the High Court, these appeals have been filed.
4. We have heard the learned Counsel for the Appellant. None appeared for the Respondents, though served.
5. Learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that the Corporation constituted under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as "Act, 1976") and Municipalities constituted under the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as "Act, 1964") are entrusted with large number of municipal functions and statutory duties. The provisions of the Act, 1974 provide for penalties and procedure also and whosoever contravenes any of the provisions of the Act, 1974, is liable to be prosecuted. The Municipal Corporation and the Municipalities, who violate the provisions of Act, 1974 are also liable to be prosecuted with. The Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation, the Municipal Council and the Chief Officers of the Municipal Council are Chief Executive Officers of the respective Corporation and Council and they being Head of the Department, being of the Corporation or the Council, are liable to be prosecuted with Under Section 74. The High Court committed error in quashing the prosecution launched against Commissioner and Chief Officer by taking an erroneous view that they are not liable to be prosecuted they being not Head of Department.
6. Learned Counsel relies on a judgment of this Court in Criminal Appeal No. 755 of 2010 - V.C. Chinnappa Goudar v. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and Anr. decided on 10.03.2015 by which the judgment of the High Court of Karnataka rejecting the applications of Commissioner and Chief Commissioner challenging their prosecution under the Act, 1974 was affirmed. He submits that High Court ought not to have quashed the proceeding in exercise of jurisdiction Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure which judgment deserves to be set aside.
7. Before we proceed to consider submissions of the Appellant, it is useful to refer to certain provisions of the Act, 1974. The Act, 1974 was enacted by the Parliament to provide for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water, for the establishment, with a view to carrying out the purposes aforesaid, of Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution, for conferring on and assigning to such Boards powers and functions relating thereto and for matters connected therewith. In Act, 1974, the Central Board and State Boards are constituted by notification in the Official Gazette. Powers and functions of the Board are provided in Chapter IV. Section 24 provides for prohibition on use of stream or well for disposal of polluting matter, etc. and Section 25 provides for restrictions on new outlets and new discharges. Section 26 contains provision regarding existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent. Section 27 deals with refusal or withdrawal of consent by State Board. Chapter VII of the Act provides for penalties and procedure. Section 41 enumerate circumstances and acts on which any person can be prosecuted. Sections 43 to 46 deals with different penalties. Section 47 deals with offences by companies and Section 48 deals with offences by Government Departments, which are relevant, are as follows:
47. Offences by companies.--(1) Where an offence under this Act has been committed by a company, every person who at the time the offence was committed was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of, the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly:
Provided that nothing contained in this Sub-section shall render any such person liable to any punishment provided in this Act if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), where an offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section-
(a) "company" means any body corporate, and includes a firm or other association of individuals; and
(b) "director" in relation to a firm means a partner in the firm.
48. Offences by Government Departments.-- Where an offence under this Act has been committed by any Department of Government, the Head of the Department shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly:
Provided that nothing contained in this Section shall render such Head of the Department liable to any punishment if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.
8. The High Court in the impugned judgment for coming to the conclusion that Commissioner of Municipal Council, Chief Officer or a Council cannot be termed as Head of the Department, has placed reliance on two earlier judgments of the High Court namely, (i) Criminal Petition No. 831 of 2007 dated 18.01.2012 and (ii) a Division Bench judgment of the High Court dated 30.10.2008 in Writ Petition (C) No. 30610 of 2008 - Sri V.C. Chinnappa Goudar v. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.
9. We have gone through the judgment of the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in V.C. Chinnappa Goudar (supra), which was a writ petition filed by a Commissioner of City Municipal Council challenging the proceeding initiated by Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the challenge in the writ petition was to quash the proceedings on the ground that action initiated against the Petitioner is without jurisdiction for want of previous sanction from the Government as per Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure The Division Bench after considering the provisions of Act, 1974 and Code of Criminal Procedure came to conclusion that no previous sanction is required for initiating the legal action against such person by Board for offence contravening Section 48 of the Act, 1974 and the writ petition was accordingly dismissed. There was neither any discussion in the judgment that Commissioner of Municipal Council is not Head of the Department of any Department of Government nor there was any ratio to the above effect. Another judgment relied by High Court is the decision of the High Court in Criminal Petition No. 831 of 2007 - - Shri D.H. Raya v. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, which is also brought on the record as Annexure P-11. The said judgment was also a petition Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure filed by Chief Officer of a Town Municipal Council praying for quashing the complaint filed by Karnataka State Pollution Control Board for offence Under Section 25 of Act, 1974. The High Court relied on the earlier Division Bench judgment of this Court in Criminal Appeal No. - 755 of 2010 - V.C. Chinnappa Goudar (supra) and allowed the petition. There was neither any discussion in the judgment that Chief Officer is not the Head of the Department of any Department of Government nor there was any ratio to the above effect. Thus, the judgment of the High Court quashing the complaint was misplaced.
10. We now need to consider as to whether Municipal Commissioner of City Municipal Council or Chief Officer of City Municipal Council are Head of the Department of any Department of Government, which was the supposed basis of the judgment of the High Court.
11. Section 48 of the Act, 1974 provides that "Where an offence under the Act has been committed by any Department of Government, the Head of the Department shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly...............". The heading of the Section is "Offences by Government Departments". Section 48, thus, is attracted where the offence is committed by any Department of Government. The question to be answered, thus, is as to whether Commissioner of City Municipal Council or Chief Officer of City Municipal Council constituted under the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 can be treated to be the Head of the Department of any Department of Government. The provisions of Act, 1974 as well as the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 have to be looked into to find answer to the above question. The City Municipal Council is a Council, incorporated Under Section 10 of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964, which is as follows:
10. Incorporation of city and town municipal councils.--(1) In every municipal area, there shall be a municipal council, and every such municipal council shall be a body corporate by the name of "the City Municipal Council of........ " or "the Town Municipal Council of........ ", as the case may be, and shall have perpetual succession and a common seal with power, subject to the provisions of this Act, to acquire, hold and dispose of property and to contract and may by the said name sue and be sued through its Chief Officer or Municipal Commissioner.
(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the municipal Government of a municipal area shall vest in the municipal council.
12. City and Town Municipal Councils as per Section 10 as quoted above is "a body corporate". Similarly, under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, the Municipal Corporations are constituted as Corporation by virtue of Section 10.
13. The concept of creating body corporate and corporation to carry out the functions of the Government is a modern concept of the Government. The modern Governments have undertaken on themselves large functions touching the life of its citizens, inhabitants. The Scheme underlying the Constitution of India entrust and oblige the Governments to carry out different functions for achieving the constitutional objectives to secure justice, liberty equality and fraternity. This Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0048/1979 : (1979) 3 SCC 489: AIR 1979 SC 1628 has noted necessity to forge a new instrumentality or administrative device to keep up with governmental functions. Following was laid down by this Court:
Now, it is obvious that the Government which represents the executive authority of the State, may act through the instrumentality or agency of natural persons or it may employ the instrumentality or agency of juridical persons to carry out its functions. In the early days, when the Government had limited functions, it could operate effectively through natural persons constituting its civil service and they were found adequate to discharge governmental functions, which were of traditional vintage. But as the tasks of the Government multiplied with the advent of the welfare State, it began to be increasingly felt that the framework of civil service was not sufficient to handle the new tasks which were often of specialised and highly technical character. The inadequacy of the civil service to deal with these new problems came to be realised and it became necessary to forge a new instrumentality or administrative device for handling these new problems. It was in these circumstances and with a view to supplying this administrative need that the public corporation came into being as the third arm of the Government.
