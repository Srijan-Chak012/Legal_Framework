JUDGMENT
1. Every litigation has a touch of human crises and, as here, it is but a legal projection of life's vicissitudes.
2. A complaint was filed by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance (Directorate of Vigilance), Cuttack, against the appellant, the former Chief Minister of Orissa Under Section 179 I.P.C., before the Sub-divisional Judicial Magistrate, Sadar, Cuttack, alleging offending facts which we will presently explain. Thereupon the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and issued summons for appearance against the accused (Smt. Nandini Satpathy). Aggrieved by the action of the Magistrate and urging that the complaint did not and could not disclose an offence, the agitated accused-appellant moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution as well as Under Section 401 of the Cr. P. Code, challenging the validity of the Magisterial proceeding. The broad submissions, unsuccessfully made before the High Court, was that the charge rested upon a failure to answer interrogations by the police but this charge was unsustainable because the umbrella of Article 20(3) of the Constitution and the immunity Under Section 161(2) of the Cr. P. Code were wide enough to shield her in her refusal. The plea of unconstitutionality and illegality, put forward by this pre-emptive proceeding was rebuffed by the High Court and so she appealed to this Court by certificate granted under Article 132(1), resulting in the above two appeals, thereby taking a calculated risk which might boomerang on the litigant if she failed, because what this Court now decides finally binds.
3. Every appeal to this Court transcends the particular Us to incarnate as an appeal to the future by the invisible many whose legal lot we decide by laying down the law for the nation under Article 141; and, so, we are filled, with humility in essaying the task of unravelling the sense and sensibility, the breadth and depth, of the principle against self-incrimination enshrined in Article 20(3) of our Constitution and embraced with specificity by Section 161(2) of the Cr. P. Code. Here we must remember, concerned as we are in expounding an aspect of the Constitution bearing on social defence and individual freedom, that humanism is the highest law which enlivens the printed legislative text with the life-breath of civilized values. The judge who forgets this rule of law any day regrets his nescient verdict some day.
4. Now, we move on to the riddle of Article 20(3), the range of the 'right to silence' and the insulation of an accused person from police interrogation Under Section 161(2) of the Cr. P. Code. Counsel on both sides have presented the rival viewpoints with utmost fairness some scholarship and we have listened to them, not as an abstract intellectual exercises peppered by lexical and precedential erudition but as deeper dives into the meaning of meanings and the exalted adventures in translation of twinkling symbols. Our Constitutional guarantees are phrased like the great sutras-pregnant brevities enwombing founding faiths.
5. The basic facts which have given rise to this case need to be narrated but the law we have to settle reminds us, not of a quondam minister, the appellant, but of the numerous indigents, illiterates and agrestics who are tensed and perplexed by police processes in station recesses, being unversed in the arcane implications of Article 20(3) and unable to stand up to rough handling despite Section 161(2). Law-in-action is tested by its restless barks and bites in the streets and its sting in hostile camps, especially when the consumers are unaware of the essential contents of the protective provisions,-and not by its polished manners and sweet reasonableness in forensic precincts. The pulse of the agitated accused, hand-cuffed and interrogated, the rude voice and ready rod of the head constable and the psychic strain, verging on consternation, sobbing into involuntary incriminations, are part of the scenario of police investigation which must educate the Court as it unveils the nuances of Article 20(3) and its inherited phraseology. A people whose consciousness of rights is poor, a land where legal services at the incipient stages are rare and an investigative personnel whose random resort to third degree technology has ancient roots-these and a host of other realistic factors must come into the Court's ken when interpreting and effectuating the constitutional right of the suspect accused to remain silent. That is why quick surgery, when constitutional questions affecting the weaker numbers are involved, can be successful failure. We are cognizant of the improved methods and refined processes of the police forces, especially the Vigilance wings and Intelligence squads with special training in expert investigation and use of brains as against brawn. This remarkable improvement, in Free India, in police practices has not unfortunately been consistent and torture tactics have not been transported for life from our land as some recent happenings have regrettably revealed. Necessarily, the Court must be guided by principled pragmatism, not cloud-cuckoo-land idealism. This sets our perspective.
The facts :
6. Back to the facts. Smt. Nandini Satpathy, a former Chief Minister of Orissa and one time minister at the national level was directed to appear at the Vigilance Police Station, Cuttack, in September last year, for being examined in connection with a case registered against her by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance, Cuttack, Under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(d) & (e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Under Section 161/165 and 120-B and 109 I.P.C. On the strength of this first information, in which the appellant, her son and Ors. were shown as accused persons, investigation was commenced. During the course of the investigation it was that she was interrogated with reference to a long string of questions, given to her in writing. Skipping the details of the dates and forgetting the niceties of the provisions, the gravamen of the accusation was one of acquisition of assets disproportionate to the known, licit sources of income and probable resources over the years of the accused, who occupied a public position and exercised public power for a long spell during which, the police version runs, the lady by receipt of illegal gratification aggrandised herself-a pattern of accusation tragically and traumatically so common against public persons who have exercised and exited from public power, and a phenomenon so suggestive of Lord Acton's famous dictum. The charge, it is so obvious, has a wide-ranging scope and considerable temporal sweep, covering activities and acquisitions, sources and resources private and public dealings and nexus with finances, personal and of relatives. The dimensions of the offences naturally broadened the area of investigation, and to do justice to such investigation, the net of interrogation had to be cast wide. Inevitably, a police officer who is not too precise, too sensitive and too constitutionally conscientious is apt to trample under foot the guaranteed right of testimonial tacitness.
