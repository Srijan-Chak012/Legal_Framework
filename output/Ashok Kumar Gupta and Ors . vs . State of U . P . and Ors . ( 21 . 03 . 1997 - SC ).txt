JUDGMENT
K. Ramaswamy, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment dated 4th August, 1983 of the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench, in Write Petition No. 3088 of 1993. The writ petition also arises from the same facts but is filed by different set of officers challenging the promotion of respondents 2 to 10 (in the writ petition) the 2nd respondent (in the civil appeal) to the post of Superintending Engineers, (Civil), Chief Engineer, Level-II (Civil), Chief Engineer Level-I and Engineer in-Chief in Public Works Department of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. The petitioners seek a writ of mandamus to restrain the first respondent from giving effect to the promotions given to Respondent Nos. 2 to 10. They also seek writ of certiorari to quash the orders dated March 12,1981 appointing the second respondent as Superintending Engineer on ad hoc basis and on regular basis w.e.f. April 10, 1991 as temporary Chief Engineer by order dated November 7, 1994 and orders promoting Harbans Lal and others as Superintending Engineers.
3. The Governor exercising the power under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution made the Uttar Pradesh Service of Engineers Public Works Department) (Higher) Rules, 1990 effective from October 15, 1990 (for short, the 'Rules') they came into force at once by operation of Rule 1(2). The services comprised there under are grouped as Group 'A' posts, consisting of various posts. Under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 4 which speaks of "Cadre of the Service", the strength of the service and of each category of the posts shall be such as may be determined by the Government from lime to time. Sub-rule (2) gives power to determine the strength of service and of each category of posts until they are ordered to be varied. The posts of Executive Engineer (Civil), Executive Engineer (Electrical and Mechanical), Superintending Engineer (Civil), Superintending Engineer (Electrical and Mechanical), Chief Engineer Level-II (Civil), Chief Engineer Level-II (Electrical and Mechanical, Chief Engineer Level-I (Civil), and Engineer-in-Chief have been specified under two categories, viz., the permanent and temporary cadre and strength in the respective cadres has been enumerated. In Part III, Rule 5 provides method of recruitment by way of promotion from the substantive posts of Assistant Engineers to the post of Executive Engineers and recruitment by promotion from amongst substantive posts of Executive Engineers to the posts of Superintending Engineers; from the Executive to Superintending Engineer Level-II and from Chief Engineer Level-II to Chief Engineer Level-I and from Chief Engineer Level-I to Engineer-in-Chief respectively. Rule 6 prescribes reservation for the candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes (for short, 'Dalits') and Scheduled Tribes (for short, 'Tribes') and other categories in accordance with the orders of the Government in force at the time of the recruitment. The qualifying service in the lower cadre for promotion to higher cadre is also prescribed. The procedure for determination of the vacancies to be reserved under Rule 6 for Dalits, Tribes and other categories has been provided in Rule 7.
4. Rule 8 adumbrates that recruitment to the post of Executive Engineer (Civil) shall be made on the basis of seniority subject to rejection of unfit and to the post of Superintending Engineer and above shall be made on the basis of merit through a Selection Committee to be constituted of officials specified there under. Recruitment to the post of Chief Engineer Level-II is by the process of screening and selection. The details thereof are not material, hence omitted. Rule 9 empowers the Government to appoint the selected candidates in the order of seniority. If more than one persons are recruited in one selection by a committee appointed in their behalf, a combined order indicating the names of persons has to be issued in the seniority order as it stood in the earlier cadre. The procedure has been prescribed in Rule 10 for declaration of the probation etc. Rule 11 empowers the Government to confirm the appointee at the end of the probation or the extended probation. Rule 12 prescribes procedure for determination of seniority. The other details are not material, hence are omitted. Rule 18 is saving provision which provides that nothing in this rule shall affect reservations and other concessions required to be provided for Dalits, Tribes and other special categories of persons in accordance with the orders of the Government issued from time to time in that regard.
5. By proceedings dated March 8, 1973, the Government had provided percentage in reservation for Dalits and Tribes @ 18% and 2% respectively in all services or posts to be filled in by promotion through process of selection either by direct recruitment or by competitive examination or limited departmental examination. The said percentage has been increased to 21% for Dalits and retained 2% for the Tribes under the U.P. Service (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994 (for short, the 'U.P. Act') that came into force with effect from December 11, 1993. It has provided for the first time reservation @ 27% to the other Backward Classes, 1973 Rules provided that if sufficient number of suitable candidates belonging to Dalits and Tribes were not available against reserved vacancies at the time of selection and if the vacancies were required to be filled up in the public interest, general category employees could be appointed on ad hoc basis. It had to be so mentioned in their orders of appointment that the provision/appointments were ad hoc and conferred no rights and that the vacancies would be carried forward to the following year. Carried forward vacancies could not exceed 45% of the total of such vacancies etc. Under Rule 3 of 1973 Rules, for suitability purpose, Dalits and Tribes were treated to be same as the general candidates, i.e., the standard of suitability was same for all the candidates. The Dalits and Tribes who fulfilled the minimum required standard of merit would be selected upto the limit of reservation. Under Rule 4, when Dalits and Tribes were promoted substantively or temporarily to the above reserved vacancies for the first time, their confirmation would be done under normal rules. The rule of the reservation was not applicable again for confirmation in their case.
6. Though the Government omitted under 1973 Rules reservation in the posts pursuant to which required recruitment by promotion on the principle of seniority subject to rejection of unfit, by the rules issued on March 20, 1974, the Government amended the same and restored recruitment by promotion to the posts on the prescribed percentage. The reservation was limited to those services only where direct recruitment was not more than 50%. The promotion thereafter was to be done according to rules and regulations under those provisions of reservation. The candidates who were eligible and suitable on the basis of seniority and were not found unfit, would be selected up to the reservation limit. Rule 2 of 1974 Rules provides for promotion to the posts where merit was also the consideration. The selected candidates from amongst the Dalits and Tribes and the general candidates would be shown in separate eligibility lists to each category. The selected candidates were to be placed according to their inter se seniority of the original post. Afterwards, all the three lists were to be compiled according to the inter se seniority and promotion were to be given against the vacancies accordingly and common seniority list was to be maintained. By orders issued on December 27, 1974, it was further clarified that "after reconsideration, the Government has withdrawn the restriction i.e. this reservation will be limited to those services only where direct recruitment is not more than 50%. The above referred G.O. will be treated to be modified accordingly." Thus, the Dalits and Tribes were to get reservation in promotion on all posts/services. By proceedings dated July 5, 1984, it was further amplified, vis-a-vis that these orders referred to hereinbefore thus: "The Government after reconsideration feels it necessary to clarify the process of preparation of separate eligibility lists in this regard".
7. Rule 2 of the 1984 order provided that:
The total vacancies for promotion on the basis of seniority subject to rejection of unfit arises in any department/office at any time shall be divided into general candidates and SC/ST candidates on the basis of G.Os. issued from time to time for reservation in promotions for these special categories. Each category shall be prepared separately in the order of their inter se seniority for available vacancies for each category and selection have been done from such eligibility list for each category on the basis of seniority subject to rejection of unfit. A combined list shall be prepared after selection of candidates from each category according to their inter se seniority.
8. For ad hoc promotion also the above principle was made applicable. In this legal backdrop, it would, thus, be seen that preceding 1990, promotions in State Service were regulated by above instructions and from 1990 Rules, they formed statutory base. The rule of reservation in promotion at all levels has, thus, been provided for the Dalits and Tribes. Under the U.P. Act it was extended to the OBCs only in direct recruitment.
9. When respondents 2 to 10 were considered and recruited as promotees from the cadre of Executive Engineer to that the Superintending Engineer and above cadres on the basis of merit, the appellants came to challenge their appointments. It was contended in the High Court and reiterated by the learned Counsel, M/s. Prag P. Tripathi and Anil Kumar Gupta that in Indira Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0104/1993 : [1992] supp. 3 SCC 217, known as Mandal's case, eight of the nine Judges, per majority [Ahmadi, J. as he then was, having not participated on this issue] held that appointment by promotion under Articles 16(1) and 16(4) of the Constitution is unconstitutional. In particular, they placed strong reliance on the judgments of Jeevan Reddy, J. Speaking for three Judges) and Sawant, J. (for himself) in that behalf. They referred to question No. 7 framed by the Bench and contended that the finding has been recorded in paras 859(7) and 860(8) by Jeevan Reedy, J, in paras 242-431 (10) by Pandian, J., in paras 323-24-D by Thommen, J. and by Kuldip Singh, J. in para 381, by Sawant, J. in para 553-553 and by Sahai, J. in paras 623-625. On that premise, it was contended that the 1996 Rules are ultra vires and the promotion of the respondents is unconstitutional. It is also contended that having declared the promotions under Articles 16(1) and 16(4) of the Constitution as unconstitutional, overruling the judgment of a Bench of five judges of this Court in The General Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari MANU/SC/0388/1961 : (1970)IILLJ289SC the same being not correct in law. Jeevan Reddy, J. with whom Kama, C.J. and Venkatachaliah, J., as he then was, had concurred, and Pandian, J. having also concurred, expressly overruled prospectively the applicability of the rule of reservation in promotion operative for a period of five years November 16, 1992 i.e., the date of the judgment. The contention of the petitioners is that it is only a minority view. The ratio, therefore, is unconstitutional. Under Article 145(5) of the Constitution, it does not constitute majority judgment.
10. Having declared that the reservation in promotion as unconstitutional, it is void ab initio under Article 13(2) of the Constitution. It bears, thereby, no legal or constitutional existence. The promotion made to respondents 2 to 10 at all levels, therefore, is unconstitutional. The operation of the unconstitutional direction cannot be postponed by prospective overruling of Rangachari's ratio. The judgment of Jeevan Reedy, J. concurred by Pandian, J. being minority judgment, cannot operate prospectively. Even if it is assumed that it is a majority judgment, it is inconsistent with and contrary to the constitutional scheme of Articles 14 and 16 violating the fundamental rights of the appellants/petitioners and, therefore, the power under Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be exercised to curtail the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.
11. There is a distinction between the conclusions and directions. Justice Pandian and Justice Sawant expressed their concurrence on the conclusions and not with directions given by Jeevan Reddy, J. The direction for prospective overruling of Rangachari's case and for operation of Mandal's ratio after five years is only by a minority of four judges. It being inconsistent with and contrary to the scheme of the Constitution in exercise of the power of judicial review, the Court cannot postpone the operation of the judgment to a future date, which violates their fundamental rights. In support thereof, they placed strong reliance on the judgment in A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak and Anr. MANU/SC/0002/1988 : 1988CriLJ1661 and Delhi Judicial Services Association, Tis Hazari v. State of Gujarat and Ors. MANU/SC/0473/1991 : AIR1991SC2150 . Having declared the reservation in promotions as void, the prospective overruling is illegal as it is no part of the doctrine of stare decisis. In support thereof, they placed reliance on Waman Rao and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0091/1980 : [1981]2SCR1 . Postponement of operation of the judgment amounts to judicial legislation which is inconsistent with the power of judicial review which empowers only to declare the law to be unconstitutional and not to make the law.
12. It is further contended that the exercise of Article 142 to postpone the operation of the judgment after five years amounts to perpetration of void action and is violative of the appellants' fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution. The order under Article 142, being only a remedial measure to do complete justice, cannot operate as a substantive right. The direction to operate the scheme of reservation in promotion for five years is inconsistent with and in derogation of the substantive right to equality guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16(1). Therefore, the scheme is unconstitutional. Prospective operation of Mandal's case amounts to judicial legislation and amounts to temporary amendment to the Constitution or an addition in the form of a proviso to Articles 16(1) or 16(4) of the Constitution.
13. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Additional Advocate General, contended that the Micro Lexicon Surgery conducted by the counsel for the appellants-petitioners to make distinction between conclusions and directions requires no detailed examination. The end result is that five out of eight learned Judges, who opined in the negative on the issue of reservation in promotion directed that reservation, from that date, will continue for five years, while giving liberty to the appropriate Government to make suitable legislative amendments. In fact, the right to promotion is a facet of right to recruitment to a post or an office under the State. No express provision is required in this behalf in Article 16(1) or 16(4) of the Constitution. After the judgment in Mandal's case, however, the Constitution (77th Amendment)Act was enacted by the Parliament which has come into force w.e.f. June 17, 1995 from which date Article 16(4A) was brought into the Constitution. It provides that "nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion of any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State". Thereby, the Parliament has re-manifested its policy that the right to reservation in promotion is a part of the constitutional scheme or public policy in order to accord socio-economic empowerment and dignity of person and status to the Dalits and Tribes. The right to reservation in promotions would be available to Dalits and Tribes in any, class or classes, of posts in the services under the State which in the opinion of the State does not get adequate representation of Dalits & Tribes. This is due to the historical evidence that the Dalits and Tribes are socially, educationally and economically deprived, denied and disadvantaged sections of the society. To make their right to equality meaningful, they are equally entitled to the facilities and opportunities, by way of reservation in promotions, and the State in compliance of the mandate of the Preamble, Articles 14 21 38 46 and 335 of the Constitution, has provided them with the right to equality of opportunity in all posts or classes of posts in the services under the State. Therefore, the majority sections of the society are required to reconcile to and accept the equal fundamental rights of Dalits and Tribes guaranteed under Articles 16 and 14 of the Constitution. The right to reservation in promotions is not an anathema to right to equality enshrined to other general candidates. The competing rights of both should co-exist and consistently be given effect by balancing the abstract doctrine of equality and the distributive justice would fill in the gap. Only upholding of affirmative action of the State by pragmatic interpretation under rule of law would enable the State to harmonise competing rights of all sections of the society.
14. There is no dichotomy or distinction between the conclusion and directions. Paragraph 860(8) should be read with the conclusions of Sawant, J. in paragraphs 552 and 555 and, therefore, the opinions of Kania, CJ, Venkatachaliah, Pandian, Sawant and Jeevan Reddy JJ., as the issue of reservation in promotion constitute majority of five Judges under Article 145(5) of the Constitution. The opinion expressed by Jeevan Reddy, J. postponing the operation of the judgment for five years, unless expressly dissented by other Judges, is law declared by majority under Article 145(5) of the Constitution. Prospective over- ruling is a part of constitutional policy. For its application, different perceptions would be considered and given effect while overruling the prior decision. Rangachari's ratio had operated as constitutional law for over three decades and rights were settled on that basis. Therefore, with a view to enable the appropriate Government to amend the law in that behalf, the operation of the judgment was postponed for five years. It is, therefore, not a judicial legislation but a part of the declaration granted by the Court. In pith and substance, it is a facet of suspending the operation of the judgment for five years so that the constitutional objective of providing reservation in promotions to Dalits and Tribes would operate without any hiatus. The decision in R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0259/1995 : [1995]2SCR35 by a Constitution Bench re-affirms that the decision in Mandal's case on promotion was by a majority. Obviously Sabharwal's ratio had upheld the principle of reservation in promotions and applied "running account theory" put forth by the State to give practical content to equality in results applying the roster points earmarked for the Dalits and Tribes, apart from equal opportunity to them to compete with the general candidates for general posts. The employees from general sections and dalits and Tribes are integrated in the roster system to harmonise the competing interests. The Dalits and Tribes selected for promotion on merit in open competition are not to be treated as part of reserved quota. That contemporaneous understanding of the operation of law is in accordance with the law laid in para 860(8) of Mandal's case. So, it is a valid direction.
15. The reservation in promotions in all the services or posts under the State of Uttar Pradesh was in vogue from March 1973. The legislature of Uttar Pradesh reiterated the need for continuance of the reservation not only in direct recruitment but also its continuance, as mentioned in the U.P. Act. The U.P. Act came into force w.e.f. December 11, 1993. The judgment in Mandal's case was delivered on November 16, 1992. All the promotions made prior to that date were held valid in Mandal's case.
16. The impugned judgment of the High Court was rendered on August 4, 1993 while the Constitution (77th Amendment) Act of 1995 came into force on June 17, 1995. The promotions of respondents came to be made between November 17, 1992 and December 11, 1993, i.e., within five years of the directions in para 860(8) in Mandal's case and agreed to by other learned Judges. Therefore, it was contended that the promotions to and appointment of the private respondents is constitutional.
17. He further contended that right to promotion is not a fundamental right to general candidates while it is so in the case of Dalits and Tribes. It is subject to rules. The policy of the Government as per the constitutional objectives is that the Dalits and Tribes should be given adequate representation in all posts or classes of posts and services under the State. Reservation in promotion is one of the policies under the Constitution and the statutory share in the governance makes no discrimination nor offend Article 14 as the rights of general and reserved employees are to be mutually balanced. The law is always presumed to be constitutional until it is declared otherwise. The Rules and the Act are constitutionally valid. By operation of Article 13(1), pre-constitutional law, if declared void, is void only from the date of the Constitution, namely, from January 26, 1950 and though the post-constitutional law may be void from its inception. To adjust the competing rights of the general and Dalit and Tribe employees, there is no prohibition for this Court to postpone the operation of the judgment in Mandal's case or to so prospectively over-rule Rangachari's ratio as to be operative from expiry of five years from the date of judgment. The intention behind the direction appears to be that the law in the transition, as per the constitutional scheme of reservation in promotions, would be smooth and operate as a continuous scheme. If the Government makes no amendment to the statute, after expiry of five years, the operation of the scheme of reservation in promotion would come to a stop. By Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995, the scheme of reservation in promotions is continued without any need to bring about amendment to the statutory rules since Article 16(4A) itself provided constitutional operation of reservation in promotion obviating the necessity to amend all statutory rules.
18. The prospective operation of law for 5 years is consistent with the doctrine of stare decisis as the declaratory law becomes operative thereafter. The ratio of Antule's case has no application. Therein, the appellant-Antule was meted out with a hostile discrimination denying him the normal trial and right of appeal and he was subjected to special trial by the High Court, depriving him of the statutory appeal violating his fundamental right to equality. Therefore, this Court had held that the direction given under Article 142 to constitute a separate Tribunal presided over by a High Court Judge was inconsistent with the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by Article 14. From that perspective, it was held therein that the exercise of power under Article 142 should be consistent with the constitutional scheme. In Golaknath v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0029/1967 : [1967]2SCR762 , it was held that the power of this Court under Article 142 is very wide and it cannot be controlled by any statutory prohibition. In Union Carbide v. Union of India MANU/SC/0058/1992 : AIR1992SC248 paragraph 83, this Court held that the competing rights are required to be adjusted by balancing them. The Court in Mandal's case, being conscious of the consequences and pervasive effect of its declaration on the policy of reservation in promotions, by the arm of the judicial review, extended the time to enable the executive to suitably amend its law. This Court, therefore, set the time limit up to which existing law would remain in operation, as the selection procedure is a continuous process to fill up existing or anticipated vacancies each year. The gap between equality in law and equality in results was bridged by Article 16(4A). It is not a case of hostile discrimination meted out to any section of the citizens but one of adjustment balancing the competing rights of two groups of the citizens of the country. The directions issued, in exercise of the power under Article 142, therefore, was not in violation of the fundamental rights of the employees belonging to the general category. The direction issued under Article 142 is, therefore, neither unconstitutional nor contrary to the law. In fact, the direction is to prevent injustice as is provided in Article 46 of the Constitution. In M. Venkateswamlu and Ors. v. Government of A.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/1187/1996 : [1996]3SCR266 , Union of India and Anr. v. Madhav s/o Gajanan Chaubal and Anr. MANU/SC/0798/1997 : (1997)ILLJ977SC , G.S.I.C. Karamchari Union and Ors. Gujarat Small Industries Corpn. and Ors. MANU/SC/1050/1997 : AIR1997SC1730 and S. Sathyapriya and Ors. v. State of A.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/1557/1996 : (1996)9SCC466 , this Court held that the Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995 has given effect to the law laid down in Rangachari's case as enshrined in Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution.
19. Shri Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing for private respondents, while adopting the arguments of Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, argued that the prospective overruling of Rangachari's ratio, the distinction of stare decisis and the constitutional invalidation of a legislative enactment may be kept in view. The ratio in Rangachari's case having prevailed the field for over three decades, majority in Mandal's case opined that the ratio in Rangachari's case would remain operative for a further period of five years. Exercise of the power of judicial review and power under Article 142 are the judicial tools given to this Court to prevent injustice. By judicial craftsmanship, the directions came to be issued to elongate the constitutional and public policy of reservation in promotion, until appropriate amendments are brought on statute within five years. He cited instances of staying the operation of the judgments by the High Court, pending grant of leave under Article 136. The decision to postpone the effect of Mandal's case is a legal policy as a part of the inherent power preserved in this Court by Article 142. The Court, by prospective operation of a statute or operation of a judgment has not sanctioned any unconstitutional scheme but intended to postpone the operation of the declaration of law to a future date. (iv) In Sampath Kumar v. Union of India MANU/SC/0851/1987 : (1987)ILLJ128SC , this Court, with a view to void constitutional crisis in dispensation of service dispute between public servants and the appropriate Government or instrumentality, by the administrative Tribunals constituted under the Administrative Tribunals Act, instead of declaring the Act ultra vires, issued mandamus to make suitable amendments to the Tribunals Act so as to be consistent with the constitutional scheme. The judicial creativity, therefore, cannot be cribbed or crabbed by any set proposition or standard formulation. They are required to be modulated depending upon the fact situation in a given case on hand and the consequences of the judgment under consideration. Rangachari's ratio having held the field for three decades, the conclusions and the directions which are integral part of para 860(8) of Mandal's judgment are part of ratio decidendi and are intended to be operative after a period of five years from the date of the judgment unless, by then, suitable amendments are brought out.
20. Dr. M.P. Raju, learned Counsel appearing for the intervener, contended that the Dalits and the Tribes have equal constitutional rights. The Constitution has provided in their favour protective and positive discrimination by providing for reservation in promotions as part of equality of opportunity, status, social and economic justice, dignity of person which were given effect to by the Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995. Reservation in promotion itself is a fundamental right to the Dalits and Tribes. They claim equality of opportunity at all levels of promotions to the respective cadres/grade/categories of posts. The right to reservation in promotion is required to be balanced with competing right to equality of the general employees. Article 16(4A) gives effect to that balancing competing right. In St. Stephen College v. Delhi University MANU/SC/0319/1992 : AIR1992SC1630 , this Court worked out the competing claims by a schemes directing minority institutions to fill up 50% of admissions by the general candidates while ensuring to the minorities their constitutional right under Article 30(1) to admit the students belonging to minority community with balance 50% seats. Such declaration is consistent not only with the scheme of the Constitution but also special protection of the rights of the minorities. Reservation in promotions in Article 16(4A) also requires same interpretation. If so viewed, there would be no violation of Article 14 or unconstitutionality of the scheme of reservation in promotion or validity under Article 13(2). The prospective overruling of Rangachari's ratio in Mandal's case, is constitutional and fulfils competing equality between sections of the society.
21. Shri Parag Tripathi, in reply, contended that Article 145(5) requires that for a judgment to be majority judgment, concurrence of the majority learned Judges constituting the Bench is necessary. There was no need for four other Learned Judges to express their concurrence with Jeevan Reddy, J. as they felt that the reservation in promotion is void from the inception, by operation of Article 13(2). Unless they agreed to the view expressed by Jeevan Reddy, J., it could not be a majority judgment. The separate judgments of the learned Judges are self- operative from the date of the judgment in the absence of their express concurrence for prospective overruling of Rangachari ratio. The prospective overruling evolved under Article 142 is inconsistent with the ratio in Waman Rao's case which had held that an amendment to the Constitution violating the fundamental right, unless the act receives protective umbrella of Schedule IX, is void from inception. The ratio in Mandal's case laid by Jeevan Reddy, J. and agreed to by other three Judges does not amount to a statutory law nor it receives any protective umbrella under Schedule IX but is one declared under Article 141. Therefore, Mandal's ratio of prospective overruling of Rangachari's case is unconstitutional and void ab initio. Article 142, therefore, does not save its voidity; nor can the void order be given effect to or saved by Article 142.
22. In The State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa and Ors. MANU/SC/0401/1973 : (1974)ILLJ121SC , a Constitution Bench had held that the code of equality and equal opportunity is a charter for equals; equality of opportunity in matters of promotion means an equal promotional opportunity for persons who fall, substantially, within the same class. A classification of employees can, therefore, be made for first identifying and then distinguishing members of one class from those of another. Classification on the basis of educational qualifications made with a view to achieving administrative efficiency was upheld.
23. In service jurisprudence, a distinction between right and interest has always been maintained. Seniority is a facet of interest. When the Rules prescribe the method of selection/recruitment, seniority is governed by the ranking given and governed by such rules as was held by a Bench of three judges in A.K. Bhatnagar and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0514/1991 : (1995)IIILLJ287SC . In Indian Admn. Service (S.C.S.) Association UP. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0643/1993 : 1992(3)SCALE126 in paras 14 & 15, another Bench of three Judges had held that no one has a vested right to promotion or seniority but an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the rules. In A.B.S.K. Sangh v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0975/1996 : JT (1996) SC 274, a Bench to which two of us, K. Ramaswamy & G.B. Pattanaik, JJ., were members, following the above ratio, held that no one has a "vested right to promotion or seniority but an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the rules". It could be taken away only by operation of valid law. In Md. Shujat Ali and 0rs. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0371/1974 : (1976)IILLJ115SC a Constitution Bench had held that Rule 18 of the Andhra Pradesh Engineering Service Rules which confers a right of actual promotion or a right to be considered for promotion is a rule prescribing conditions of service. In Md. Bhakar v. Krishna Reddy (1970) SLR 768, another Bench of three Judges had held that any rule which affects the promotion of a person relates to conditions of service. In State of Mysore v. G.B. Purohit (1967) SLR 753 a Bench of two judges had held that the rule which merely affects chances of promotion cannot be regarded as varying a condition of service. Chances of promotion are not condition of service. In Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar v. State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0391/1973 : (1974)ILLJ221SC , a Constitution Bench had held that a rule which merely affects the chances of promotion does not amount to change in the conditions of service. In Syed Khalid Rizvi and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0682/1992 : (1993)ILLJ887SC , a Bench of three Judges following the above ratio, with approval, had held at page 602 para 31, that no employee has a right to promotion but he has only the right to be considered for promotion according to rules. Chances of promotion are not conditions of service and are defeasible in accordance with the law.
24. In the light of this normal run of service jurisprudence, the question emerges whether the right to promotion is a fundamental right and the direction of prospective operation of the decision in Mandal judgment, after five years, violates equality enshrined in Articles 14 and 16(1) and is void under Article 13(2) of the Constitution? Right to reservation itself is a fundamental right under Article 16(1) as was laid in State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas MANU/SC/0479/1975 : (1976)ILLJ376SC which was reiterated in Mandal's case. The permanent bureaucracy in Part XIV of the Constitution is an integral scheme of the Constitution to aid and assist the political executive in the governance of the country. Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest Presidents of the United States of America, a noble soul, who laid his life in giving right to equality to the Blacks, a living truth enshrined in 14th Amendment, had stated that democracy, is by the people, of the people and for the people. Democracy governed by rule of law brings about change in the social order only through rule of law. Every citizen or group of people has right to a share in the governance of the State. The Dalits and Tribes equally being citizens have a right to a share in the governance of the State and in the permanent democracy service conditions are assured under Articles 309 to 312A of the Constitution subject to the pleasure of the President under Article 310 and also the express exclusion of its applicability to the specified services in Articles 33 and 34. The right to seek equality of opportunity to an office or a post under the State is a guaranteed fundamental right to all citizens alike under Article 16(1), the specie of Article 14, the genus. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan Tale MANU/SC/0396/1983 : (1983)IILLJ256SC it was held that public employment opportunity is a national wealth and all citizens are equally entitled to share it. In Delhi Transport Corporation v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress and Ors. MANU/SC/0031/1991 : (1991)ILLJ395SC it was held that law is a social engineering to remove the existing imbalance and to further the progress, serving the needs of the Socialist Democratic Bharat under the rule of law. The prevailing social conditions and actualities of life are to be taken into account in adjudging whether or not the impugned legislation would sub-serve the purpose of the society.
25. The historical evidence of disabilities worked against the Dalits and the Tribes received acknowledgment in Articles 17 which provides for abolition of practice of untouchability, Article 15(2) which provides prohibition of access to public places and Article 29(2) which provides for prohibition of denial of admission into educational institutions. So social, educational and economic protection is provided to them under Article 46 of the Constitution. Article 335 which is part of the scheme of equality of opportunity in governance of the State in Chapter XVI, by a special provision, enjoins the State that the claims of the members of the Dalits and the Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the efficiency of administration in the making of appointment to service and post in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. In Comptroller & Auditor General v. K.S. Jagannalhan MANU/SC/0066/1986 : [1986]2SCR17 a Bench of three judges had held that Article 335 is to be read with Article 46 which enjoins that the State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections, in particular, the Dalits and the Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice. Article 38 of the Constitution enjoins the State to secure and protect a social order in which justice, social economic and political shall inform all the institutions of the national life. The State shall, in particular, strive to minimise the equalities in income, and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, "facilities" and "opportunities", not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations. The Preamble of the Constitution assures to every citizen justice, social, economic and political and "equality of status" and opportunity assuring dignity of the individual to integrate all sections of the society in an integrated Bharat.
26. In Consumer Education & Research center and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/1113/1995 : [1995] 3 SCC 45 and Air India Statutory Corporation etc. v. United Labour Union and Ors. Etc. MANU/SC/0163/1997 : (1997)ILLJ1113SC and Daimia Cements (Bharat) Ltd. and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/1585/1996 : (1996)10SCC104 social justice was held by three-Judge Benches to be a fundamental right approving the view taken in C.E.S.C. Ltd. and Ors. v. Subhash Chandra Bose and Ors. MANU/SC/0466/1992 : (1992)ILLJ475SC . In Murlidhar Dayanadeo Kesekar V. Vishwanath Pandu Barde and Anr. MANU/SC/1046/1995 : [1995]2SCR260 ; R. Chandevarupa and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. MANU/SC/0805/1995 : (1995)6SCC309 and Papaiah v. State of Karnataka and Anr. MANU/SC/0712/1997 : AIR1997SC2676 right to economic empowerment was held by the two-Judges Benches of this Court to be a fundamental right.
27. It is now settled legal position that social justice is a fundamental right and equally economic empowerment is a fundamental right to the disadvantaged. Article 51A(j) enjoins that it shall be the duty of every citizen to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activities so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. Equality of status and dignity of the individual will be secured when the employees belonging to Dalits and Tribes are given an opportunity of appointment by promotion in higher echelons of service so that they will have opportunity to strive towards excellence individually and collectively with other employees in improving the efficiency of administration. Equally they get the opportunity to improve their efficiency and opportunity to hold offices of responsibility at hierarchical level.
28. In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras MANU/SC/0012/1950 : 1950CriLJ1383 , per majority, the Constitution Bench had held that the operation of each Article of the Constitution and its effect on the protection of fundamental rights is required to be measured independently and not in conjoint consideration of all the relevant provisions. The above ratio was overruled by a Bench of 11 Judges in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India MANU/SC/0011/1970 : [1970]3SCR530 . This Court had held that all the provisions of the Constitution conjointly be read on the effect and operation of fundamental right of the citizens when the State action infringes the right of the individual. In D.T.C. case (supra) MANU/SC/0031/1991 : (1991)ILLJ395SC it was held that:
It is well settled constitutional law that different articles in the chapter on Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles in Part IV of the Constitution must be read as an integral and incorporeal whole with possible overlapping with the subject matter of what is to be protected by its various provisions particularly the Fundamental Rights.
