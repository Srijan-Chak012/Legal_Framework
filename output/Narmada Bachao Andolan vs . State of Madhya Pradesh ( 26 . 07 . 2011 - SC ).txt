LETTER PETITION AND PIL MATTER - SLPs FILED AGAINST JUDGMENTS/ORDERS PASSED BY THE HIGH COURTS IN WRIT PETITIONS FILED AS PIL
JUDGMENT
B.S. Chauhan, J.
1. This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 16.12.2010 passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur in Writ Petition No. 1360 of 2009.
2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are as under:
A. In the year 1972, the State of Madhya Pradesh conceived a dam to provide irrigation facilities to farmers of Khargone district. The dam, on filling upto full, would cause submergence of 1258.59 hectares of land, out of which 1037.715 is private and 206.635 is government and 14.24 hectares is forest land.
B. On 10.1.1992, a detailed Project Report was prepared and submitted to the State Government and the Final Project Report was approved by Technical Committee of Central Water Commission vide order dated 6.5.1997. Clearance to the project was given by the Government of India. It was on 10.10.2002 that the project was accorded Environmental and Forest clearance.
C. The Cabinet of Ministers in its meeting dated 4.10.2002 approved payment of Special Rehabilitation Grant (hereinafter called SRG) to be paid to oustees, who would not ask for land in lieu of land acquired. As a consequence thereof, order dated 28.12.2002 was issued to the same effect in the name of the Governor of the State of Madhya Pradesh.
D. On 23.5.2004, construction of dam site commenced and was completed upto crest level in the year 2008; only gates were required to be installed so as to achieve full reservoir level of 317 metres. Subsequent thereto, Notification dated 5.3.2008 was issued regarding submergence of four villages, namely, Sonud, Nimit, Bedhaniya and Khamid.
E. Appellant approached the High Court by filing writ petition No. 1360 of 2009 claiming various reliefs, inter-alia, to stop further construction which may cause submergence so that displaced families are resettled and rehabilitated in 6 months before the submergence; to direct State Government to provide irrigated agricultural land to eligible oustees including encroachers and landless labourers; to declare the order dated 7.6.1991 passed by Narmada Valley Development Department (hereinafter called NVDD) amending para 5.1 of the Re-settlement and Rehabilitation Policy, 1991 (hereinafter called R & R Policy) to be ultra vires and unconstitutional, being arbitrary and mala fides.
F. The State Authorities opposed the writ petition contending that the validity of the R & R Policy had already been upheld by the courts; landless labourers were not entitled for allotment of agricultural land; the writ petition was filed at much belated stage, i.e. after completion of the dam; Appellant had an alternative efficacious remedy before the Grievance Redressal Authority (hereinafter called GRA); amendment in para 5.1 of the R & R Policy was only procedural, and carried out legally and was thus valid; even otherwise the amendment to para 5.1 was inconsequential because the allotment of land for the oustees is provided under Clause 3 of the R & R Policy and amendment carried out in Clause 3 of the Policy at subsequent stage had not been challenged by the Appellant.
G. The High Court considered the rival submissions advanced on behalf of the parties and held that challenge to the validity of the amendment dated 7.6.1991 was belated and could not be entertained. The alternative remedy before the GRA was efficacious and no extraordinary situation prevailed warranting the High Court to interfere at such a stage. The landless labourers were not entitled for allotment of agricultural land. The oustees had been offered grant; the value of their land had also been assessed under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter called 'the Act 1894'). Person aggrieved, if any, can approach the GRA if he is not satisfied with the reliefs granted to him in terms of the R & R Policy. After taking the aforesaid view, the High Court issued various directions including: to install radial gates, block sluice gates and to fill up dam upto 310 metres; when canal network is ready, the Government could approach the Court to fill up the dam to 317 metres; the Government would ensure that land oustees were given benefits to which they are entitled under the R & R Policy within four weeks; and that persons aggrieved, if any, were at liberty to agitate the grievances in respect of reliefs before the GRA.
Hence, this appeal.
3. Ms. Chittaroopa Palit, representative of the Appellant, has raised before us all the issues which had been agitated before the High Court, including the right of oustees for allotment of land in lieu of land acquired and non-compliance of R&R Policy is violative of fundamental rights of the oustees enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution. It has further been submitted by her that the amendment in Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy was null and void as it has not been carried out in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 as well as the provisions of Article 166(2) and (3) of the Constitution of India. Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy could not be amended in violation of Rule 7(viii) of Part II of the Business Rules. And that since the Ministry of Welfare, Government of India, has accorded clearance to the project with a clear understanding that landless labourers would also be allotted agricultural land and as the same has not been complied with, the High Court's judgment requires interference.
4. On the contrary, Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing for the Respondents has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy deals with procedure only. Entitlement for allotment of land is provided under Clause 3.2 of the R & R Policy and as the amendment to the said clause was not challenged, amendment to Clause 5.1 remains inconsequential. Dam construction started in year 2004 and compensation for land acquired had been determined much ago. By December 2002, the benefit of SRG had also been given to the oustees. The writ petition was filed in year 2008 after the dam stood fully constructed. At the time of filing the writ petition there was no challenge to Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy, rather it was challenged seeking amendment by filing an application dated 11.5.2010. Amendment to Clause 5.1 of R & R Policy has been in conformity with the Business Rules of the Government and all the orders in this respect had been passed in the name of the Governor. The Council of Ministers had delegated the power to the NVDD and to the Hon'ble Minister for Rehabilitation and in case there was any difference between the said two Hon'ble Ministers, the matter would be referred to the Hon'ble Chief Minister. The law permits delegation of power to make routine changes in subordinate legislation. Therefore, no fault can be found with the procedure adopted for amendment of Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy.
Mr. Patwalia further asserts that so far as the entitlement of relief in favour of landless labourers etc. is concerned, this Court has dealt with the issue in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. State of M.P. MANU/SC/0599/2011 : AIR 2011 SC 1989 (hereinafter called "Narmada Bachao Andolan III") and all the issues agitated in this appeal have been answered in the said judgment. The appeal lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed.
5. We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.
6. This Court in Narmada Bachao Andolan III (supra) has dealt elaborately with most of the issues agitated in this appeal, particularly, the issues of delay and laches, availability of alternative remedy, entitlement of major sons and daughters of oustees/as well as the landless labourers for allotment of agricultural land. The issues of land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement of oustees considering their fundamental and constitutional rights under Articles 21 and 300-A of the Constitution of India have been dealt with elaborately therein. This Court held:
These cases are to be decided giving strict adherence to the R & R Policy, as amended on 3.7.2002, further considering that special care is to be taken where persons are oppressed and uprooted so that they are better off. Our Constitution requires removal of economic inequalities and provides for provision of facilities and opportunities for a decent standard of living and protection of economic interests of the weaker segments of the society and in particular Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Every human being has a right to improve his standard of living. Ensuring people are better off is the principle of socio-economic justice which every State is under obligation to fulfil, in view of the provisions contained in Articles 37, 38, 39(a), (b), (e), (f), 41, 43, 46 and 47 of the Constitution of India.
Thus, the case in fact requires to be disposed of in terms of the said judgment.
7. Ms. Palit has submitted that as the High Court did not consider the issue of amendment of Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy and the effect of non-compliance of the condition imposed by the Ministry of Welfare while granting the clearance for the project, this Court must examine the said issues.
According to Ms. Palit, while making the amendment the procedure prescribed under Article 166 of the Constitution has not been followed and while granting the clearance, the Ministry of Welfare has added the clause that families of the landless labourers would be given agricultural land to the extent of 2 hectares which has not been given.
Thus, this appeal is being considered to be restricted to these two issues.
Amendment to Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy:
8. The NVDD vide Resolution dated 18.11.1987 proposed liberal amended policy for the oustees of the Narmada Projects and submitted the same for approval to the Cabinet of Ministers, Government of Madhya Pradesh. The said proposal was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, Government of M.P. on 25.11.1987. Subsequently, the NVDD vide Resolution dated 28.8.1989 proposed certain modifications in the rehabilitation policy and the summary of the same was submitted for the approval to the Cabinet of Ministers, Government of M.P. The said proposal specifically provided for delegation of power to the NVDD and Rehabilitation Department to make routine/general amendment in R & R Policy with the permission of the Ministers-in-charge of the said two departments. The Council of Ministers vide resolution dated 1.9.1989 approved the said proposal.
9. Certain amendments were sought in R & R Policy vide resolution dated 5.9.1989. The NVDD, in consultation with the Rehabilitation Department and after seeking approval of the Ministers-in-charge of both the said Departments, amended Clauses 4.1, 5.1 and 8.3 of the R & R Policy and issued the amended policy on 7.6.1991 in the name of the Governor of the State. The copy of the said amendment order was issued to 44 officers concerned as is evident from the record. Clause 4.1 of the R & R Policy was amended to facilitate the tenure holders, who were voluntarily willing to sell their lands, "as far as possible" to alienate the same and further providing for procedure for determination of reasonable price of such lands. Clause 5.1 was amended to the effect that if an oustee family does not wish to obtain land in lieu of the submerged land and wishes full payment of the amount of compensation, it can do so by submitting an application to this effect in writing to the concerned Land Acquisition Officer. In such cases, the oustee families would have no entitlement over allotment of land and would be paid full amount of compensation. An option once exercised under this provision would be final, and no claim for allotment of land, in lieu of the land, acquired could be made afterwards. If any oustee family belonging to the Scheduled Tribes submits such an application, it will be essential to obtain orders from the Collector, who would after necessary enquiry certify that it would not adversely affect the interests of the oustee family. Such applications of the Scheduled Tribes oustee families could be accepted only after the said certification by the Collector. Clause 8.3 was also amended changing the size of plots to be allotted to the oustees etc.
10. Subsequently on 24.10.2002, NVDD submitted the summary to Council of Ministers for approval of SRG for oustees of Narmada Projects, particularly in respect of those oustees who were not claiming land in lieu of the land acquired, and the said proposal was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. As a consequence, the order dated 28.12.2002 was issued giving effect to the said amendment in the name of the Governor of the State of Madhya Pradesh.
11. On 27.4.2002, the amendment was made in Clause 3.2 of the R & R Policy putting the words "as far as possible" for allotment of agricultural land to the oustees in lieu of the land acquired.
12. The aforesaid chronological development of amendment of R & R Policy reveals that Clause 3 of the R & R Policy provided for entitlement of oustees to get land in lieu of the land acquired. Clause 5 prescribed only the procedure for allotment of land under Clause 3 of the R & R Policy. The amendment of R & R Policy on 7.6.1991 which is under challenge by the Appellant only facilitates those oustees who were not willing to take the land in lieu of the land acquired. Such an amendment was brought on demand of the oustees as an alternative. However, it does not take away the right of the oustees to claim land in lieu of the land acquired, for the simple reason that there was no amendment in year 1991 to Clause 3.2 of the R & R Policy and the amendment to the said Clause 3.2 incorporated on 27.4.2002 is not under challenge. The amendment under challenge simply facilitated an oustee to claim compensation instead of land. This may be for the reason that oustee may be willing to settle in another State or in urban area or wants to adopt any other vocation/profession or wants to start any other business. However, it does not take away the right of any oustee to claim the land in lieu of the land acquired. Therefore, in our opinion, amendment to Clause 5.1 remains inconsequential so far as the right of an oustee to claim land in lieu of the land acquired is concerned. Ms. Palit could not explain that in case her averment was accepted and the amendment to Clause 5.1 dated 7.6.1991 stood struck down, what benefit could an oustee derive from the same. In view of the above, we do not find any force in the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant on this count.
13. In view of our conclusion reached herein that amendment to Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy was inconsequential so far as entitlement of allotment of agricultural land in lieu of land acquired was concerned, grievance of the Appellant that procedure adopted for its amendment was not in conformity with the Statutory/Constitutional requirement becomes purely an academic issue, not required to be determined as Ms. Palit could not point out as what prejudice the said amendment could cause to an oustee. However, as we have heard the issue at length, it is desirable to decide the same also.
Procedure adopted for amendment:
14. Ms. Palit has submitted that the procedure adopted for amendment of Clause 5.1 of the R & R Policy is not in consonance with the provisions of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and Article 166(2) and (3) of the Constitution. Rule 7 of the Business Rules, Part II provided for the cases to be brought before the Council of Ministers. Clause (viii) thereof reads:
Proposals to vary or reverse a decision previously taken at meeting of the Council.
15. In Sampat Prakash v. The State of Jammu and Kashmir and Anr. MANU/SC/0320/1968 : AIR 1970 SC 1118, this Court held:
This provision (Section 21) is clearly a rule of interpretation which has been made applicable to the Constitution in the same manner as it applies to any Central Act or Regulation.... As an example, under Article 77(3), the President, and, under Article 166(3) the Governor of a State are empowered to make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of India or the Government of the State, as the case may be, and for the allocation among Ministers of the said business. If, for the interpretation of these provisions, Section 21 of the General Clauses Act is not applied, the result would be that the rules once made by the President or a Governor would become inflexible and the allocation of the business among the Ministers would forever remain as laid down in the first rules. Clearly, the power of amending these rules from time to time to suit changing situations must be held to exist and that power can only be found in these articles by applying Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.
