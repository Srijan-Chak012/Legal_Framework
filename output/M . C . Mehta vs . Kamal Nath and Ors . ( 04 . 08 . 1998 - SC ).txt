LETTER PETITION AND PIL MATTER
ORDER
1. In its report dated 17-12-1996, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has suggested the steps which can be taken for protecting the ecology and environment in the region of River Beas. Before proceeding further on the basis of the said report of NEERI, we consider it necessary that the State of Himachal Pradesh should examine the said report and come up with its own plan of action. Since the various owners of properties along the river banks would be benefited by the plan that is prepared, they should also be heard before any action is taken on the basis of such plan
2. The learned counsel for the State of Himachal Pradesh prays for eight weeks' time for the State Government to submit its plan of action. Time prayed for is allowed. The learned counsel shall submit the list of the owners of properties who are likely to be benefited by the plan. The suggested plan of action and the list of owners of properties shall be filed by 6-10-1998
3. List on 13-10-1998.
