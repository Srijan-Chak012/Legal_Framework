MINES, MINERALS AND MINING LEASES
JUDGMENT
R.V. Raveendran, J.
1. These appeals by special leave against the judgment dated 11.5.2004 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Madras in W.A. Nos. 3241-42/2003 and connected cases, relate to the validity and scope of Rule 38A of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 (for short 'the Rules') which reads as under:
38-A. Quarrying of sand by the State Government:-
Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, or any order made or action taken thereunder or any judgment or decree or order of any Court, all existing leases for quarrying sand in Government lands and permissions/leases granted in ryotwari lands shall cease to be effective on and from the date of coming into force of this rule and the right to exploit sand in the State shall vest with the State Government to the exclusion of others. The proportionate lease amount for the unexpired period of the lease and the unadjusted seignior age fee, if any, will be refunded.
Background facts
2. We may briefly refer to the circumstances leading to the insertion of Rule 38A in the Rules. A public interest litigation (W.P. No. 985/2000) was filed in the Madras High Court, complaining about indiscriminate illicit quarrying of sand in riverbeds. The High Court issued certain directions to curb illicit quarrying while disposing of the said writ petition. A contempt petition (Contempt Application No. 561/2001) was filed complaining of non-implementation of the said directions by the State Government. In the said contempt proceedings, the High Court issued a direction to the State Government on 26.7.2002 to constitute a High Level Committee consisting of scientists, geologists and environmentalists to conduct a thorough scientific survey of the sand quarrying activities in rivers and riverbeds in the State and submit a report regarding the damage caused on account of indiscriminate illicit quarrying and to suggest the remedial measures. The High Court also suggested that a suitable regulatory legislation may be made by the State on the basis of the report of such Committee, and issued certain interim directions pending such legislation.
3. Accordingly, a High Level Committee was constituted which submitted a report detailing the extensive damage that had occurred on account of haphazard, irregular and unscientific manner of quarrying sand by the quarry leaseholders, thereby impairing smooth flow of water and causing damage to riverbeds, river banks as also the structures (like bridges and transmission power lines constructed across rivers or imbedded on the riverbed) and drinking water systems branching from rivers, leading to ecological imbalances. It was found that the unauthorized use of Proclaim machines for quarrying, and the tendency of lessees to extend quarrying activities beyond the leased area and the permissible depth, were the main causes for the devastating situation. The Committee suggested several measures to remedy the situation, one of which was to impose total prohibition on quarrying by private parties. On considering the said report, the State Government took a decision in public interest to stop quarrying of sand in Government lands and Ryotwari (private patta) lands by private agencies and take upon itself exclusively, all sand quarrying activities in the State. It is in this background, Rule 38A came to be inserted in the Rules by Notification dated 1. 10.2003 with effect from 2.10.2003.
4. Prior to insertion of the said Rule, the State Government was granting quarrying leases, the term of such leases being three years or less, under Rule 8 of the Rules. It is stated that as on 2.10.2003, private agencies were holding 135 sand quarrying leases granted by the State Government and 52 permissions for sand quarrying in Ryotwari lands. Out of these, 19 were to expire in 2003, 102 were to expire in 2004, 33 were to expire in 2005 and the remaining 33 were to expire in 2006; and in addition, sand quarrying was carried on by some others on the authority of orders of court, even though no leases had been granted in their favour. With effect from 2.10.2003, the State Government stopped all sand quarrying by private agencies. Several writ petitions were filed in the Madras High Court by the Lessees/permission holders, challenging Rule 38A.
Decision of the High Court
5. On 8.10.2003, a learned Single Judge of the High Court granted an interim stay, until further orders or till the leases granted to the writ petitioners came to an end, whichever was earlier. Being aggrieved by the interim stay, the State Government moved the matter before a Division Bench immediately which in turn issued an interim direction on the same day (8.10.2003) directing both parties not to quarry sand from areas covered by leases or court orders, until further orders. Subsequently, the writ petitions, which were pending before the learned Single Judge, were taken up for hearing by the Division Bench along with the writ appeals against the interim order, and were disposed of by a common order dated 11.5.2004.
6. The Division Bench upheld the validity of Rule 38A in so far as it created an exclusive right in the State to quarry sand. It was, however, of the view that the leases/permissions which had already been granted and were in force as on 2.10.2003 when the Rule came into force, could not be terminated without giving a hearing to the concerned lessees/permission-holders. Consequently, it upheld the validity of Rule 38A subject to the following conditions:
1. The State is entitled to exploit the sand by quarrying itself on the Government lands, which are not covered by the mining leases of the writ petitioners. The same is applicable to patta lands subject to the permission of the landholders or their tenants or lessees in occupation, which are not covered by the mining leases.
2. The writ petitioners whose Mining leases expired as on this day and which are covered by the Court orders shall not be entitled for any relief. This will not cover the Court orders passed to make up the deficiency of the lease period.
3. The respective District Collectors shall issue notices to the petitioners with regard to the mining leases where there is an allegation of infraction of environmental laws and if there is a contest, then hold an enquiry by affording opportunity to them and then pass orders basing on the material on record. The above exercise shall be made by the District Collector within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and until then, the status quo with regard to mining operations as obtained on this day, shall be maintained.
4. In so far as the cases not covered by environmental violations are concerned, the said writ petitioners shall be entitled to continue their sand quarry operations till the expiry of their respective lease periods. But this shall not preclude the respondents/Government from terminating their leases by issuing a prior notice of six months as contemplated under Clause 11 of Appendix I of the Rules in so far as the Government lands are concerned.
5. In the cases relating to the petitioners, where there is an allegation of breach of conditions of lease, then a notice has to be issued to them affording opportunity and then pass orders basing upon the material on record. But until then, they shall be entitled to quarry.
Some of the writ petitioners, being aggrieved by the judgment upholding validity of Rule 38A, approached this Court. This Court did not entertain the SLPs.
The Contentions & the Issue
7. The State has challenged the judgment of the High Court in these appeals by special leave, being aggrieved by the conditions stipulated by the court while upholding the validity of Rule 38A. According to the State, the Rule ought to have been upheld unconditionally, so that there could be cessation of all quarrying activities relating to sand in the State by private agencies with effect from 2.10.2003. Though leave was granted on 5.9.2005, the interim prayer of the State to stay the conditions imposed by the High Court was not granted. Instead, hearing was expedited. The State has raised the following contentions:-
(i) The High Court having upheld the validity of Rule 38A, ought not to have excluded the existing leaseholders (in regard to Government lands) and permission holders (in regard to Ryotwari lands) from the operation of the said rule. Continuation of quarrying operations by the existing leaseholders/permission-holders would negate the very purpose (to save riverbeds from indiscriminate quarrying) of the amendment to the Rules by adding Rule 38A.
(ii) The State has the power to regulate the grant of quarrying and mining leases relating to minor minerals by making appropriate rules, in view of the power delegated to it by the Parliament under Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (for short the 'Act'). The power to regulate includes the power to prohibit, in appropriate cases. Termination of all quarrying leases and permissions is nothing but prohibition of quarrying by lease/permission holders. The State was, therefore, well within its power in making a rule which directed cessation of quarrying of sand by all lease/ permission holders in the State and Rule 38A in entirety is valid.
(iii) The decision to put an end to all leases/permissions was not arbitrary or unreasonable. Rule 38A manifested the policy of the State Government, formulated after duly considering all relevant aspects and the recommendations of the High Level Committee. Therefore, the High Court erred in imposing conditions, for the applicability of Rule 38A to existing lease/permission holders.
8. The validity of Rule 38A in so far as it seeks to vest the exclusive right in the State Government, in regard to sand quarrying, does not arise for our consideration as the High Court has held that creation of such monopoly is not illegal having regard to the scheme of the Act and the decisions of this Court recognizing the right of the State to create such monopoly in State of Tamil Nadu v. Hind Stone and Ors. MANU/SC/0394/1981 : [1981]2SCR742 and Gem Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu MANU/SC/0607/1995 : [1995]1SCR476 . In Hind Stone (supra), this Court held that the power of regulation vested in the State Government can extend to total prohibition of leases and the State was entitled, in exercise of its regulatory power, in appropriate cases, to take over exclusive exploitation of a particular minor mineral or give it to a sole agency or prohibit exploitation by private agencies with the intention of conservation and prudent exploitation. In Gem Granites (supra), this Court held that the State Government as owner of a minor mineral, may decline to give any lease to quarry such minor mineral to anyone and may engage in such quarrying operations itself. Therefore, the High Court rightly held that Rule 38A reserving the exclusive right of quarrying sand, in itself, to the exclusion of others, was valid and did not suffer from any infirmity. This Court also refused to entertain the SLPs., filed by lessees in view of the said settled legal position.
9. The question that arises in these appeals by the State relates to the other part of the Rule, that is, whether the State can, while making a rule providing for exclusive vesting of right to exploit sand in itself, provide that all existing leases relating to quarrying of sand in Government land (and all existing permissions to quarry sand in ryotwari lands) shall cease to be effective on and from the date when such rule comes into force, and that too without providing a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the aggrieved lease/permission holders. In other words, the question is whether Rule 38A ought to be upheld unconditionally or whether holders of existing leases (Government lands) and permissions (ryotwari lands) should be protected till the expiry or termination of their leases/permissions as per law.
10. The Respondents contend that Rule 38A does not conform to Section 4A(3) of the Act. It is pointed out that Sub-section (3) of Section 4A of the Act mandates that no order making a premature termination of a mining lease shall be made except after giving the holder of the lease a reasonable opportunity of being heard; and that it, therefore, follows that any Rule made by the State Government for regulating mining leases in respect of minor minerals, in exercise of the rule- making power conferred by the Act, should conform to Section 4A(3); and that Rule 38A made by the State, to the extent it provides for termination or cessation of all existing leases/permissions relating to sand, without affording a hearing to the affected leaseholder/s, is clearly contrary to the express provisions of Section 4A(3) is invalid.
Legal Provisions
11. A brief reference to the relevant provisions of the Act and Rules will facilitate decision on the said question.
11.1) Section 3(e) of the Act defines "Minor minerals" as building stones, gravel, ordinary clay, ordinary sand (other than sand used for prescribed purposes), and any other mineral which the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a minor mineral. Section 4 requires the mining operations to be under leases granted under the Act and the Rules made thereunder. Section 4A deals with termination of mining leases. While Sub-section (1) enables the Central Government to request the State Government to terminate a mining lease in respect of any mineral other than a minor mineral in the circumstances stated therein, Sub-section (2) enables the State Government to make premature termination of mining lease in regard to minor minerals. We extract below Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 4A which are relevant for our purpose:-
(2) Where the State Government is of opinion that it is expedient in the interest of regulation of mines and mineral development, preservation of natural environment, control of floods, prevention of pollution or to avoid danger to public health or communication or to ensure safety of buildings, monuments or other structures or for such other purposes, as the State Government may deem fit, it may, by an order, in respect of any minor mineral, make premature termination of prospecting licence or mining lease with respect to the area or any part thereof covered by such licence or lease.
(3) No order making a premature termination of a prospecting licence or mining lease shall be, made except after giving the holder of the licence or lease a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
11.2) Section 15empowers the State Government to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith. Section 17 deals with the special power of the Central Government to undertake prospecting or mining operations in certain lands. Section 17A provides for reservation of any area (not already held under any mining lease) for purposes of conservation of any mineral or for undertaking mining operations through any company/corporation owned by the Central Government or State Government.
11.3) The Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 were made by the State Government in exercise of its power under Section 15 of the Act. Rule 1(3) provides that the said Rules shall apply to all the lands in the State of Tamil Nadu. Rule 2(6) defines "quarry", "quarrying leases" and "quarrying operations" and provides that they shall have the same meaning assigned to "mine", "mining lease" and "mining operations" in the Act. Rule 8 relates to leasing of Government lands for quarrying minor minerals (other than certain types of granites covered by Rules 8-A and 8-C). It contemplates the District Collector granting lease to an applicant who offers the highest bid amount for an area advertised and notified for grant of such lease, followed by execution of a lease deed by the State Government and the lessee. Sub-rule (8) of Rule 8 provides that the period of quarry lease for sand shall be three years; and Sub-rules (8) and (11) of Rule 8 make it clear that a lease granted under Rule 8 shall neither be extended nor be renewed. Rule 15 provides for absolute prohibition or regulation of quarrying or removal of sand from riverbeds to which Madras River Conservancy Act, 1884 has been extended and for regulating the quarrying or removal of sand from beds of river in charge of the Public Works Department. The form of lease for quarrying and removing minor minerals by private persons is contained in Appendix I to the Rules and Clause 11 thereof provides that such lease may be terminated by six months notice in writing on either side (without any right in the Lessee to seek compensation). It is not in dispute that all quarrying leases granted by the State Government contained such a provision for termination simplicitor. Rule 36 deals with general restrictions in respect of quarrying operations. The proviso to Sub-rule (1) of Rule 36 provides that there shall be no quarrying of any minor mineral in the river beds or adjoining areas within 200 meters radial distance from the location of any bridge, water supply system, infiltration well, or pumping installation of any of the local bodies or Central or State Governments or the State Water Supply and Drainage Board head works. Sub-rule 5(c) of Rule 36 provides that the lessees and permit holders shall carry out quarrying operations in a skilful, scientific and systematic manner, keeping in view proper safety of the labour, structure and the public, and public works located in that vicinity of the quarrying area and in a manner to preserve the environment and ecology of the area.
Whether the Rule is valid in entirety ?
12. There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality or validity of a sub-ordinate Legislation and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that it is invalid. It is also well recognized that a sub-ordinate legislation can be challenged under any of the following grounds:-
a) Lack of legislative competence to make the sub-ordinate legislation.
b) Violation of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India.
c) Violation of any provision of the Constitution of India.
d) Failure to conform to the Statute under which it is made or exceeding the limits of authority conferred by the enabling Act.
e) Repugnancy to the laws of the land, that is, any enactment.
f) Manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness (to an extent where court might well say that Legislature never intended to give authority to make such Rules).
