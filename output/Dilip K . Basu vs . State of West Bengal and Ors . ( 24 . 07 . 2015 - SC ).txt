Facts

The Amicus in a criminal appeal filed a summary of recommendations, which need to be examined and accepted while concluding the proceedings. He sought suitable directions for setting-up of State Human Rights Commissions in the States of Delhi, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland, where such Commissions have not been setup. Despite an opportunity granted for the purpose, the States had failed to set-up Human Rights Commissions had not offered a justification for their omission. It was contended by the States that the establishment of a Commission was not mandatory in terms of Section 21 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. In the absence of any mandatory requirement under the Act constitution of a State Human Rights Commission cannot be required. The Amicus made various other submissions to reduce incidences of human rights violations.

Held, disposing off the petition

1. The use of word 'may' in Section 21 of the Act, 1993 is not by itself determinative of the true nature of the power or the obligation conferred or created under a provision. The use of word 'may' does not always mean that the authority upon which the power is vested may or may not exercise that power. Whether or not the word 'may' should be construed as mandatory and equivalent to the word 'shall' would depend upon the object and the purpose of the enactment under which the said power is conferred as also related provisions made in the enactment. The word 'may' has been often read as 'shall' or 'must' when there is something in the nature of the thing to be done which must compel such a reading. The decision in Bachahan Devi and Anr. v. Nagar Nigam, Gorakhpur and Anr. dispels the impression that if the Parliament has used the words "may" and "shall" at the places in the same provision, it means that the intention was to make a distinction in as much as one was intended to be discretionary while the other mandatory. Even when the two words are used in the same provision the Court's power to discover the true intention of the legislature remains unaffected. The functions of receiving cases from the National Human Rights Commission, spreading human rights literacy and the protection of human rights are critical for the promotion and protection of human rights at the State level. A contention that State Human Rights Commissions were not to be mandatory to be set up would be destructive of the scheme of the Act, 1993.The States of Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland shall within a period of six months from today set up State Human Rights Commissions for their respective territories with or without resort to provisions of Section 21(6) of the Act, 1993.[9],[12],[14] and[31]

2.All vacancies, for the post of Chairperson or the Member of SHRC wherever they exist at present shall be filled up by the State Governments concerned within a period of three months.

3.Vacancies occurring against the post of Chairperson or the Members of the SHRC in future shall be filled up as expeditiously as possible but not later than three months from the date such vacancy occurs.

4.The State Governments shall take appropriate action in terms of Section 30 of the Act, 1993, in regard to setting up/specifying Human Rights Courts.

5.The State Governments shall take steps to install CCTV cameras in all the prisons in their respective States, within a period of one year, but not later than two years.

6.The State Governments shall also consider installation of CCTV cameras in police stations in a phased manner depending upon the incidents of human rights violation reported in such stations.

7.The State Governments shall consider appointment of non-official visitors to prisons and police stations in terms of the relevant provisions of the Act wherever they exist in the Jail Manuals or the relevant Rules and Regulations.

8.The State Governments shall launch in all cases where an enquiry establishes culpability of the persons in whose custody the victim has suffered death or injury, an appropriate prosecution for the commission of offences disclosed by such enquiry report and/or investigation in accordance with law.

9.The State Governments shall consider deployment of at least two women constables in each police station wherever such deployment is considered necessary having regard to the number of women taken for custodial interrogation or interrogation for other purposes over the past two years.[31]

JUDGMENT
T.S. Thakur, J.
1. In D.K. Basu etc. v. State of West Bengal etc. MANU/SC/0157/1997 : (1997) 1 SCC 416 [D.K. Basu] this Court lamented the growing incidence of torture and deaths in police custody. This Court noted that although violation of one or the other of the human rights has been the subject matter of several Conventions and Declarations and although commitments have been made to eliminate the scourge of custodial torture yet gruesome incidents of such torture continue unabated. The court described 'custodial torture' as a naked violation of human dignity and degradation that destroys self esteem of the victim and does not even spare his personality. Custodial torture observed the Court is a calculated assault on human dignity and whenever human dignity is wounded, civilisation takes a step backwards. The Court relied upon the Report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure and the Third Report of the National Police Commission in India to hold that despite recommendations for banishing torture from investigative system, growing incidence of torture and deaths in police custody come back to haunt. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0311/1994 : (1994) 4 SCC 260; Smt. Nilabati Behera alias Lalita Behera v. State of Orissa and Ors. MANU/SC/0307/1993 : (1993) 2 SCC 746; State of M.P. v. Shyamsunder Trivedi and Ors. MANU/SC/0722/1995 : (1995) 4 SCC 262; and the 113th report of the Law Commission of India recommending insertion of Section 114B in the Indian Evidence Act, this Court held that while the freedom of an individual must yield to the security of the State, the right to interrogate the detenus, culprits or arrestees in the interest of the nation must take precedence over an individual's right to personal liberty. Having said that the action of the State, observed this Court, must be just and fair. Using any form of torture for extracting any kind of information would neither be right nor just or fair, hence, impermissible, and offensive to Article 21 of the Constitution. A crime suspect, declared the court, may be interrogated and subjected to sustained and scientific interrogation in the manner determined by the provisions of law, but, no such suspect can be tortured or subjected to third degree methods or eliminated with a view to eliciting information, extracting a confession or deriving knowledge about his accomplices, weapons etc. His constitutional right cannot be abridged except in the manner permitted by law, though in the very nature of things there would be a qualitative difference in the method of interrogation of such a person as compared to an ordinary criminal. State terrorism declared this Court is no answer to combat terrorism. It may only provide legitimacy to terrorism, which is bad for the State and the community and above all for the rule of law. Having said that, the Court issued the following directions and guidelines in all cases of arrest and/or detention:
35. We therefore, consider it appropriate to issue the following requirements to be followed in all cases of arrest or detention till legal provisions are made in that behalf as preventive measures:
(1) The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name togs with their designations. The particulars of all such police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register.
(2) That the police officer carrying out the arrest of the arrestee shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest a such memo shall be attested by atleast one witness who may be either a member of the family of the arrestee or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made. It shall also be counter signed by the arrestee and shall contain the time and date of arrest.
(3) A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a police station or interrogation centre or other lock-up, shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare being informed, as soon as practicable, that he has been arrested and is being detained at the particular place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee.
(4) The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an arrestee must be notified by the police where the next friend or relative of the arrestee lives outside the district or town through the legal Aid Organisation in the District and the police station of the area concerned telegraphically within a period of 8 to 12 hours after the arrest.
(5) The person arrested must be made aware of this right to have someone informed of his arrest or detention as soon he is put under arrest or is detained.
(6) An entry must be made in the diary at the place of detention regarding the arrest of the person which shall also disclose the name of he next friend of the person who has been informed of the arrest and the names and particulars of the police officials in whose custody the arrestee is.
(7) The arrestee should, where he so requests, be also examined at the time of his arrest and major and minor injuries, if any present on his/her body, must be recorded at that time. The "Inspection Memo" must be signed both by the arrestee and the police officer effecting the arrest and its copy provided to the arrestee.
(8) The arrestee should be subjected to medical examination by trained doctor every 48 hours during his detention in custody by a doctor on the panel of approved doctors appointed by Director, Health Services of the concerned Stare or Union Territory. Director, Health Services should prepare such a penal for all Tehsils and Districts as well.
(9) Copies of all the documents including the memo of arrest, referred to above, should be sent to the illaqa Magistrate for his record.
(10) The arrestee may be permitted to meet his lawyer during interrogation, though not throughout the interrogation.
(11) A police control room should be provided at all district and state headquarters, where information regarding the arrest and the place of custody of the arrestee shall be communicated by the officer causing the arrest, within 12 hours of effecting the arrest and at the police control room it should be displayed on a conspicuous notice board.
