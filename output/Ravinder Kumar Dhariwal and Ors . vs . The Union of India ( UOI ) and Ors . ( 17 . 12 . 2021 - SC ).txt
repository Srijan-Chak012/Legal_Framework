Case Note:
Service - Disciplinary proceedings - Challenge against its initiation - First inquiry report questioned - Section 47 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (PwD Act) - Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD) - Whether proceedings could have been initiated against mentally disabled person?

Facts:

The Division Bench by impugned finding allowed appeal against the judgment of Single Judge in petition challenging the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the Appellant. The Single Judge had directed State to consider the case of the Petitioner in view of Section 47 of the PwD Act. The Division Bench had set aside the enquiry report and restored the proceedings to the stage of evidence.The Appellant had joined the Central Reserve Police Forceas Assistant Commandant. While the Appellant was serving in Ajmer during the relevant period, a complaint was lodged against him alleging Appellant of being obsessed with either killing or being killed and made a threat that he could shoot. Notice was issued pursuant to department enquiry conducted. Appellant challenged the inquiry report and the notice in the first enquiry in a writ proceeding. The Single Judge of the High Court passed an interim order directing that no further decision to be taken in the disciplinary proceedings initiated in the first enquiry and later the petition was allowed. The Respondents filed an intra-court appeal contending that Appellant raised the contention of mental disability for the first time in the writ petition. It was argued that this contention had neither been raised in the reply to the charge sheet nor in the reply to the enquiry report. The appeal was partly allowed by the Division Bench and the enquiry proceedings were restored to the stage of recording evidence to enable the Appellant to prove his mental disability by submission of material documents.

Held, while allowing the Appeal:

The validity of the disciplinary proceedings shall be determined against the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016 instead of the PwD Act, 1995. The Respondent holds a privilege under the 2002 notification to not comply with the principles of non-discrimination and reasonable accommodation provided under Section 47 of the PwD Act. However, for a privilege to accrue in terms of Section 6 of the GCA, mere expectation or hope is not sufficient. Rather, the privilege-holder must have done an act to avail of the right. The privilege provided by the 2002 notification would accrue only when one of the punishments provided under Section 47 has been imposed. However, in the instant case, the disciplinary proceedings were challenged even before the punishment stage could be reached. Therefore, the privilege available to the Respondent under the 2002 notification was not accrued in terms of Section 6 of the GCA. The disciplinary proceedings are discriminatory and violative of the provisions of the RPwD. A person with a disability is entitled to protection under the RPwD Act as long as the disability was one of the factors for the discriminatory act. The mental disability of a person need not be the sole cause of the misconduct that led to the initiation of the disciplinary proceeding. Any residual control that persons with mental disabilities have over their conduct merely diminishes the extent to which the disability contributed to the conduct. The mental disability impairs the ability of persons to comply with workplace standards in comparison to their able-bodied counterparts. Such persons suffer a disproportionate disadvantage due to the impairment and are more likely to be subjected to disciplinary proceedings. Thus, the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against persons with mental disabilities is a facet of indirect discrimination.[106]

The disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant relating to the first enquiry are set aside. The Appellant is also entitled to the protection of Section 20(4) of the RPwD Act in the event he is found unsuitable for his current employment duty. While re-assigning the Appellant to an alternate post, should it become necessary, his pay, emoluments and conditions of service must be protected. The authorities will be at liberty to ensure that the assignment to an alternate post does not involve the use of or control over fire-arms or equipment which may pose a danger to the Appellant or others in or around the work-place.[107]

Appeal allowed.[108]

Conclusion
1. The Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court allowed an appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court in a petition Under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the Appellant. The Single Judge had directed the State to consider the case of the Petitioner in view of Section 47 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 19951. Allowing the appeal against the order of the Single Judge, the Division Bench set aside the enquiry report and restored the proceedings to the stage of evidence.
A. Factual Background
2. The Appellant joined the Central Reserve Police Force2 in November 2001. In 2003, he was appointed as Assistant Commandant and served in the Darrang and Haflong Districts of Assam. Between the years 2005 to 2007, he served as Assistant Commandant in Chhattisgarh, and between 2007 to 2008, he served in Srinagar. Subsequently, he was transferred to Ajmer where he was serving till 2010. On 18 April 2010, while the Appellant was serving in Ajmer, the Deputy Inspector General of Police3 lodged a complaint against him in the Alwar Gate police station alleging that the Appellant had stated that he was obsessed with either killing or being killed and made a threat that he could shoot. The complaint reads as follows:
It is to mention that in pursuance to the above referred letter, Sub Inspector Udai Singh came in the chamber of DIGP and when sitting with Sh. V.K. Kaundal Commandant (staff) and with Sh. Sarwar Khan, Asstt. Comdt. Then only Sh. R.K. Dhariwal who was posted in this Group Centre threatened that he is obsessed with either to kill or being killed and he can even shoot. Thus it is evident that the mental state of this officer is not sound and he can take life of anybody and can commit suicide and likewise.
3. An enquiry was initiated against the Appellant. A memorandum was issued on 8 July 2010 whereby the President proposed to hold an enquiry against the Appellant Under Rule 14 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1965. Six charges were framed against him which were that he remained absent from morning marker, used unparliamentary language, appeared in television channels and other print media without the prior approval of the Department, did not give parade report, tried to intentionally cause an accident, and assaulted a Deputy Commandant. The Appellant was placed under suspension with effect from 8 October 2010 with the declared headquarter. The departmental enquiry was completed, and the enquiry officer submitted the enquiry report dated 3 October 2013. Pursuant to the enquiry report, notice was issued to the Appellant on 7 August 2015.
4. A second enquiry was initiated against the Appellant through a memorandum dated 6 April 2011 on the charge that the Petitioner without depositing the pistol and ammunition proceeded to Mukhed. The enquiry has been completed and the punishment of withholding two increments was awarded.
5. A third enquiry was initiated against the Appellant. The memorandum was issued on 17 February 2015 on the charges that when the Appellant was placed under suspension with the declared headquarter pursuant to the initiation of the first enquiry report, he remained absent without obtaining permission.
6. It is also necessary that we advert to the medical history of the Appellant to understand the full purport of the issues before us. The Appellant started facing obsessive compulsive disorder4 and secondary major depression in 2009. He visited a private psychologist at Kota, Rajasthan in 2009 and 2010. He also attended Kochhar psychiatric Centre, Delhi in 2011 and 2012. In 2012-2013, he received treatment in PGIMS, Rohtak. He was also treated at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital at Chandigarh in 2013. In 2015, he visited Gauhati Medical College for psychiatric treatment. He also visited the Composite Hospital, Gauhati in 2015 and was referred to the Composite Hospital in Delhi, where he was admitted for treatment between 4 August 2015 to 7 August 2015. He was subsequently referred to Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Delhi where he was categorized as permanently disabled, having 40 to 70 percent disability. The Composite Hospital by a report dated 18 July 2016, declared the Appellant unfit for duty and placed him under the S5(P) category due to his partial and limited response to all modalities of treatment since 2009.
7. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, in exercise of powers Under Section 47 of the PwD Act issued a notification on 10 September 2002,5 exempting all categories of 'combatant personnel' of the CRPF from the provisions of the Section. The notification reads as follows:
NOTIFICATION
New Delhi, the 10th September, 2002
S.O. 995(1)-In exercise of the powers conferred by proviso to Section 47 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights, and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (I of 1996) the Central Government having regard to the type of work carried on hereby exempt all categories of posts of 'combatant personnel' only of the Central Para Military Forces (CPMFs) namely Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Assam Rifles from the provisions of the said Section.
8. The PwD Act was repealed by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 20166. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, in exercise of powers conferred by the proviso to Section 20 of the RPwD Act issued a notification dated 18 August 2021, similar to the 2002 notification:
NOTIFICATION
New Delhi, the 18th August, 2021
S.O. 3367(E).--In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 20 and the second proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 34 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (49 of 2016), the Central Government, in consultation with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, having regard to the nature and type of work, hereby exempts all categories of posts of combatant personnel of Central Armed Police Forces, namely, Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Sashastra Seema Bal and Assam Rifles from the provisions of the said sections.
9. A standing order on the rehabilitation of force personnel was issued by the Directorate General, CRPF on 27 July 2011. According to the order, a rehabilitation Board would be constituted which will subject the concerned person to critical examination to determine their physical and mental capacity, aptitude and job requirement among others. Pursuant to the examination, it would be determined by the Board if the person can be rehabilitated within the force or whether he should be declared unfit. The order provided a list of jobs that can be given to persons required to be rehabilitated which included duties such as light duty, line men, and hospital attendants. As for persons who hold the rank of an ASI or above, they are to be posted in comparatively less operational activities. The above standing order was amended on 14 August 2012 altering the list of rehabilitative jobs.
10. The Appellant challenged the inquiry report and the notice dated 7 August 2015 issued in the first enquiry in a writ proceeding. The Single Judge of the High Court by an order dated 7 August 2015 issued notice and passed an interim order directing that no further decision shall be taken in the disciplinary proceedings initiated in the first enquiry. The contentions raised by the Appellant were:
(i) He has a disability within the meaning of Section 2(i) (vii) of the PwD Act. He is suffering from a mental illness with a disability of more than 40 percent; and
(ii) He is protected Under Section 47 of the PwD Act which provides that a person shall not be demoted or denied promotion on the grounds of disability. In view of Section 47, the disciplinary proceedings cannot proceed any further.
The CRPF submitted that the Court should not interfere with the disciplinary proceedings in view of the seriousness of the charges, and the enquiry must be allowed to be completed.
11. The Single Judge of the Gauhati High Court by a judgment dated 19 August 2016 allowed the writ petition and directed the Respondent to consider the case of the Petitioner in terms of the provisions of Section 47 of the PwD Act. The reasons which guided the Single Judge are as follows:
(i) Section 47 of the PwD Act states that no establishment shall dispense with or reduce in rank, an employee who acquires a disability during his service. The provision also vests a positive obligation on the employer to reasonably accommodate an employee, who owing to his disability is no more suitable for the post that he is holding. The provision states that he could be shifted to another post in the same pay-scale, and in case it is not possible to shift him to another post, he is to be kept on a supernumerary post until a suitable post is available;
(ii) There is no dispute that the Petitioner had acquired disability during his service. The mental disability certificate from Dr. Ram Mohan Lohia Hospital, New Delhi is sufficient to establish that the Appellant has a mental disability of over forty percent;
(iii) The Supreme Court in Kunal Singh v. Union of India MANU/SC/0106/2003 : (2003) 4 SCC 524 held that Section 47 of the PwD Act is mandatory; and
(iv) In view of the above, the Respondent should revisit the issue as to whether any action based on the enquiry report would serve any purpose in view of the mandatory directive Under Section 47.
12. The Respondents filed an intra-court appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge. The Respondents contended that the Appellant raised the contention of mental disability for the first time in the writ petition. It was argued that this contention had neither been raised in the reply to the charge sheet nor in the reply to the enquiry report. The Appellant argued that his wife had tried to bring the mental health issues faced by him to the notice of the enquiry committee. However, the committee did not permit her to place the submissions. The appeal was partly allowed by the Division Bench by a judgment dated 15 November 2018, by which the enquiry proceedings were restored to the stage of recording evidence to enable the Appellant to prove his mental disability by submission of material documents. The reasons which guided the Division Bench were as follows:
(i) The issue of whether the Appellant is suffering from mental disability cannot be decided in a writ proceeding since it would require the evaluation of evidence, which cannot be undertaken by the High Court in an Article 226 proceedings. In these circumstances, the application of the provisions of the PwD Act is faulty;
(ii) Even if the PwD Act is held applicable to the disciplinary proceedings, an argument has been made that the 2002 notification had been issued exempting the CRPF from the application of Section 47 of the PwD Act. However, the applicability of the provisions of the PwD Act is dependent on an affirmative finding on the mental disability of the Appellant; and
(iii) On a prima facie perusal of the material, it appears that the Appellant has a mental disability. The medical reports submitted by the Appellant from the Respondent's hospital indicate that he had OCD and depression for a long time. However, this is a defence that must be put forth by the Appellant during the enquiry.
B. Submissions of Counsel
13. Mr. Rajiv Raheja, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, has made the following submissions:
(i) The Appellant was continuously posted in areas where anti-insurgency operations were being conducted from 2003 to 2010. As a consequence, he developed mental health issues in 2008;
(ii) The Appellant is diagnosed with OCD, secondary major depression, and bipolar affective disorder, which he developed during service. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital categorized the Appellant as having a permanent disability in the range of 40-70 percent;
(iii) The Appellant started taking treatment from a psychiatrist in 2009-2010. He has taken treatments from Apollo Hospital Delhi, Rohtak Medical College, Government Hospital Chandigarh, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital Delhi, and Gauhati Medical College;
(iv) The events which led to the initiation of departmental enquiries took place between April 2010 and July 2012. An FIR was registered against the Appellant at the behest of the DIGP under whom the Appellant was serving in Ajmer. It was alleged in the complaint that the Appellant's mental state is not sound, and he threatened to kill people and commit suicide. Instead of sending the Appellant for medical treatment, the DIGP initiated criminal action against him. Thereafter, three enquiries were instituted against the Appellant;
(v) The departmental enquiries were initiated against the Appellant for acts committed by him after developing severe mental illnesses;
(vi) The first and third enquiries against the Appellant are pending. The first enquiry has been restored to the stage of evidence by the High Court in the impugned judgment. The second enquiry is completed and the punishment of withholding two increments has been awarded to the Appellant;
(vii) Section 18(5)(b) and (d) of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 mandates that persons with mental illness should be posted in their native places and where good treatment facilities are available. The Appellant was being treated in Delhi in 2010 but was posted to Mudkhed in Maharashtra making it impossible for him to avail of medical care every fortnight or even every month. In October 2014, the Appellant was first posted in Gauhati and thereafter in Silchar. These locations are far from his hometown and treatment centers;
(viii) The Composite Hospital, CRPF, Delhi admitted that the Appellant has OCD and secondary major depression. Further, it acknowledged that the Appellant has taken various treatments and was subjected to anti-anxiety agents, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, sedatives, hypnotics, psychotherapy, behavior therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy;
(ix) The Appellant showed only partial response to the treatment and is still symptomatic. He was categorized as S-3 but was eventually classified as S-5 (permanent disability from the psychiatric side, 100 percent unfit) by the Medical Directorate of CRPF;
(x) On 14 April 2019, even the Court of Enquiry noted that the Appellant has been diagnosed with OCD and secondary major depression. The Appellant was directed to appear for review before medical officers;
(xi) The behavior report issued by DIG, GC, CRPF, Gauhati dated 9 January 2019 stated that no duty was assigned to the officer due to "mental disorder" and that the "officer caught mental disorder on duty". In another behavior report dated 27 January 2018, it was noted that the "officer has not been performing any duties since he is psychiatric patient". DIG, GC, CRPF, Silchar in the behavior report dated 5 January 2019 observed that the "officer lacks proper reasoning and in making proper conclusive opinion [sic]". Thus, while the CRPF concluded that the Appellant has a severe mental illness, it still chose to proceed with departmental enquiries;
(xii) The Appellant made several requests for being transferred to the place where he was undergoing treatment. The last such request was made on 16 March 2020;
(xiii) The principles of natural justice were not followed in the departmental enquiries. Further, it is unreasonable to expect a person undergoing severe mental health issues to lead evidence and defend himself;
(xiv) The Appellant is entitled to the protection granted Under Section 20 of the RPwD Act, which is pari materia to Section 47 of the PwD Act;
(xv) The exemption granted to CRPF from the application of provisions of Section 47 under the PwD Act in terms of the notification dated 10 September 2002 does not have any effect once the RPwD Act 2016 came into force; and
(xvi) The order of the Department of Personnel and Training dated 25 February 2015 nullifies the exemption granted to the CRPF by the 2002 notification.
14. Ms. Madhavi Divan, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Respondents, has urged that:
(i) The Appellant was involved in various acts of misconduct during 2010 and 2011, for which three different departmental enquiries were initiated against him;
(ii) Both the pending departmental enquiries have been put on hold till the Appellant's mental condition improves;
(iii) The Appellant was transferred from time to time following the transfer policy. The good work done by the Appellant in the past has no relevance to the specific charges of misconduct against him;
(iv) Exposure to insurgency does not result in the development of mental health issues. Innumerable officers are posted in such areas and are performing their duties;
(v) The acts of misconduct were committed by the Appellant when he was posted at a peaceful station in Ajmer. He was residing near his hometown and was availing of static/home posting. Rajasthan is his home state. If he had any grievance against a senior officer, he should have followed proper procedure for registering such a grievance;
(vi) The DIG, Ajmer CRPF was constrained to register an FIR against the Appellant because there was an apprehension that the Appellant will commit an untoward act;
(vii) The Appellant did not produce himself before the medical officer of the force for treatment. There is no indication from the reports of medical officers that he has any mental ailment;
(viii) According to AMR reports dated 20 October 2008, 28 October 2009 and 26 June 2014, the Appellant was placed in the medical category S-1 and was declared fit for duty. These reports do not indicate that the Appellant has any mental illness;
(ix) The Appellant actively participated in the first and second departmental enquiries which were conducted from 2010 to 2014. He cross-examined witnesses and submitted a defence. He never claimed that he had a mental health disorder. When the first departmental enquiry was completed by the Investigating Officer and the Union Public Service Commission advised that he be removed from service, the Appellant claimed that he had mental illnesses to avoid the penalty;
(x) The Mental Healthcare Act was enacted in 2017, while the acts of misconduct relate to 2010 and 2011 when he was posted in Ajmer;
(xi) The Appellant has been deployed in peaceful stations since 2014. He was posted in Gauhati from 2014 to 2018 and in Silchar from 2018 onwards. Adequate medical facilities are available in these areas. Family accommodation is also available;
(xii) The Appellant was sent for Review Medical Examination in Composite Hospital, CRPF, Delhi where he was placed in the S-5 category on 31 August 2016. He was declared unfit for duty on account of being diagnosed with OCD and secondary depression. It was recommended that his service be invalidated. To avoid such invalidation, the Appellant produced two medical certificates issued by Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, which declared him fit for any activity stating that he had no symptoms of a mental illness;
(xiii) The Appellant has taken contradictory stands. In the first enquiry, he claimed that he had a mental illness to avoid a penalty but when he was declared unfit for duty, he claimed to be medically fit. It is clear that the ploy of mental illness is being used to mislead the department and the Court;
(xiv) On the order of the High Court dated 15 November 2018, a Review Medical Examination was conducted which placed the Appellant in the medical category of S-3 because of OCD and secondary depression. At the time, the Appellant was asymptomatic and was not on any medication. However, because he had a record of mental illness, he was placed under observation in medical category S-3 for 24 weeks. Thereafter, Review Medical Examinations were conducted from 23 December 2019 to 30 December 2019 in Composite Hospital, CRPF. The Appellant was placed in medical category S-3 on 31 December 2019;
(xv) The Appellant has been evading Review Medical Examinations because he is aware that if he is upgraded to the S-1 category, then the pending departmental enquiries will recommence and if he is downgraded to S-5 category, he will be boarded out of service;
(xvi) The Review Medical Examinations conducted from 20 January 2021 to 29 January 2021 place him in medical category S-2;
(xvii) The contention of the Appellant that the exemption granted to the CRPF from the application of Section 47 of the PwD Act was overruled by order of Department of Personnel and Training dated 25 February 2015 is incorrect;
(xviii) After the enactment of the RPwD Act, a proposal was submitted to the Central Government to exempt the CRPF from the provisions of Section 20 of the RPwD Act. A notification to this effect was issued in 2021; and
(xix) According to the department standing orders, when CRPF personnel with mental illness are placed in medical category S-3 for a maximum of 48 weeks and are not upgraded to S-2 within 48 weeks, they are downgraded to S-5 and declared permanently unfit for service. Under the rehabilitation policy relating to disabled force personnel, persons having a mental illness are immediately invalidated from service irrespective of their fitness at the time of recruitment. They cannot be retained or rehabilitated within the force since the job profile of the CRPF personnel involves handling firearms.
C. Analysis
15. The PwD Act was repealed and the RPwD Act was enacted in 2016 during the pendency of the writ proceedings. Therefore, we first determine the law applicable to the validity of the disciplinary proceedings. We would then discuss the legal frameworks on mental health. The final Section discusses whether the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant was discriminatory.
C.1 Changing legal Regimes and the continuing quest for Justice
16. When the writ petition seeking to quash the disciplinary proceedings was instituted before High Court, the PwD Act and the 2002 notification were in force. However, the intra-court appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge was filed in 2017, after the RPwD Act came into force. An exemption corresponding to the 2002 notification was issued under the RPwD Act in August 2021 when the Special Leave Petition was pending before this Court. Therefore, the primary issue is to decide the law that would apply to the proceedings before this Court.
17. The disciplinary proceedings were initiated by issuing a memorandum of charges in 2010. The enquiry report was submitted in 2013, and the notice was issued in 2015. Thus, when the disciplinary proceedings were initiated, the PwD Act was in force. The 2002 notification was issued by the Respondent under the proviso to Section 47, exempting the CRPF from the application of the provision. The RPwD Act came into force on 27 December 2016. If any right has been accrued to either the Appellant or the Respondent Under Section 47 or any other provisions of the PwD Act, then the repeal of the Act would not affect the legal proceedings unless a different intention appears from a reading of the RPwD Act, by virtue of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 18977. Section 6 of the GCA reads as follows:
6. Effect of repeal-Where this Act, or any [Central Act] or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not-
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed; or
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any enactment so repealed; or
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not been passed.
Section 6 provides that where a central enactment repeals another enactment, the repeal shall not affect any legal proceeding or investigation with respect to an accrued right, unless a different intention appears from the repealing statute. The general Rule of interpretation is that a newly enacted statute has prospective application. Section 6 of the GCA provides an exception to this rule, where a pending legal proceeding or investigation would be guided by the old enactment, if any 'right, privilege, obligation or liability' has accrued to the parties under the repealed law. The issue which needs to be considered is whether any right, privilege, obligation or liability has accrued to the Respondent in view of the 2002 notification which exempts the CRPF from its duty to not discriminate against disabled employees Under Section 47 of the PwD Act.
C.1.1 Section 6 of GCA: Accrual of Privilege
18. Section 47 of the PwD Act reads as follows:
47. Non-discrimination in Government employments.--
(1) No establishment shall dispense with, or reduce in rank, an employee who acquires a disability during his service:
Provided that, if an employee, after acquiring disability is not suitable for the post he was holding, could be shifted to some other post with the same pay scale and service benefits:
Provided further that if it is not possible to adjust the employee against any post, he may be kept on a supernumerary post until a suitable post is available or he attains the age of superannuation, whichever is earlier;
(2) No promotion shall be denied to a person merely on the ground of his disability:
Provided that the appropriate Government may, having regard to the type of work carried on in any establishment, by notification and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified in such notification, exempt any establishment from the provisions of this section.
Section 47 states that no employee working in a Government establishment, who acquires a disability during the course of service shall be (i) terminated from employment; (ii) reduced in rank; or (iii) denied promotion. Section 47 protects disabled employees from punitive actions on the ground of disability. Since the 2002 notification exempts the CRPF from the application of Section 47, we will have to examine if any right or privilege has accrued to the CRPF under the 2002 notification. This requires us to consider whether an exemption from a protective provision such as Section 47 results in the accrual of a right or privilege in favour of the CRPF to continue pending proceedings under the PwD Act in terms of Section 6 of the GCA.
19. In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. v. Amrit Lal & Co. MANU/SC/0488/2001 : (2001) 8 SCC 397, the issue before a two judge Bench of this Court was whether the court of Rent Controller constituted under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, or the ordinary civil court would have the jurisdiction to decide the eviction proceedings instituted by the landlord against the tenant. Section 3 was amended to exclude tenancies whose monthly income exceeded Rs. 3500 from the application of the Delhi Rent Control Act. In that case, the monthly rent was Rs. 8625. The eviction petition was filed by the landlord in 1985 before the amendment of Section 3. While the petition was pending, Section 3 was amended, which excluded such tenancies from the purview of the Act. The High Court had held that in view of the amendment, only the ordinary civil court and not the Rent Controller would have jurisdiction over the eviction proceedings. The tenant contended that since the tenant did not possess any vested right under the Act before the amendment came into force, the Rent Controller would not have jurisdiction. The landlord contended that even if the tenant did not possess any vested right, the landlord possessed a vested right, and that in view of Section 6 of GCA, the pending proceedings should continue under the pre-amended Rent Control Act. This Court held that the tenant did not have any vested right under the Act. Furthermore, the Court also held that the landlord does not have an accrued 'right' Under Section 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act. Section 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act provides a general protective right to the tenant against eviction. The proviso to Section 14 lists specific grounds on which the tenant could be evicted. The Court held that since Section 14 is a protective right conferred upon the tenant, it cannot be construed to provide a right to the landlord. In this context, it was observed:
The right which is sought to be referred as vested right is only under its proviso. Proviso cannot enlarge the main section. When main Section is only a protective right of a tenant, various Sub-clauses of its proviso cannot be construed as it gives vested right to a landlord. The right if at all could be said of the landlord. It flows only under the protective tenant's umbrella which cannot be enlarged into a vested right of a landlord.
