ORDER
1. C.A. Nos. 3163-64/95. These appeals by special leave arise from the judgment dated January 18, 1995 of the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in writ appeal Nos. 416 and 187 of 1992. The Division Bench, doubting the correctness of the judgment in Public Service Commission v. Dr. Kanjamma Alex (1981) KLT 24 (subject matter of CA No. 1197/81) had referred the question to the Full Bench. Facts lie in a short compass and are stated as under :
2. Two posts of Lecturers in Law Department of Cochin University were notified for recruitment, one of which was reserved for Latin Catholics (Backward Class-Fishermen). The appellant, a Syrian Catholic (a forward class), having married a Latin Catholic, had applied for selection as a reserved candidate. The University selected her on that basis and accordingly appointed her against the reserved post. Her appointment was questioned by one Rani George by filing a Writ Petition, viz., O.P. No. 9450/91 praying for a direction to the University to appoint her in place of the appellant to the said post. The learned single Judge allowed the writ petition of Rani George and held that the appointment should be made strictly in accordance with Rules 14 to 17 of the Kerala State Subordinate Service Rules. When appeals were filed, the appellant cited the judgment a single Judge in Dr. Kaniamma Alex v. Public Service Commission (1980) KLT 18 which later stood upheld in Public Service Commission v. Dr. Kanjama Alex (1980) KLT 24. As stated earlier, doubting the correctness of the decision of the Division Bench in Dr. Kanjamma Alex's case, the reference to the Full Bench had come to be made.
3. The Full Bench in the impugned judgment held that though the appellant was married according to the Canon Law, the appellant, being a Syrian Catholic by birth, by marriage with a Latin Catholic (Backward Class), is not a member of that class nor can she claim the status as a backward class by marriage. The special provisions under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution intended for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens cannot be defeated by including candidates by alliance or by any other mode of joining the community. It would tantamount to making a mockery of the constitutional exercise of identification of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens. Accordingly, the Full Bench overruled the decision of the Division Bench and of the single Judge referred to hereinbefore. The appeal challenging the Division Bench Judgement in respect of Dr. Kanjamma Alex, (Civil Appeal No. 1197/81) is placed before us alongwith these appeals.
4. The question is one of constitutional importance to harmonize the personal law of the citizens and the constitutional goal, viz., to accord equal opportunity to the disadvantaged social segments, envisaged in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution. Shri T.L.V. Iyer, learned senior counsel for the appellant, contended that though the appellant is a Syrian Catholic (a forward class) by birth and had voluntarily married J. Yesudas, a Latin Catholic (Fishermen community), admittedly a backward class, she had entered into the marital home of her husband in the year 1982 and was received and recognised by the community as a member of the Latin Catholic. Due to her marriage, she has subjected herself and suffered all the environmental disabilities to which her husband, J. Yesudas, was subjected and to which all other members of backward class in the region are subjected to. She cannot therefore, be discriminated by denying equality given by Article 16(4) of the Constitution. He elaborated the contention arguing that birth by itself is not a determinative factor for claiming protective discrimination given to the backward classes. Environmental and social disabilities are also relevant factor to which the appellant had volunteered by subjecting herself to them and that, therefore, she is entitled to the same treatment as is available to the Latin Catholics (Fishermen) to which she was transplanted by marriage according to Canon Law. Therefore, the view of the Full Bench is not correct in law. He placed strong reliance on the Judgment of this Court in Principal, Guntur Medical College, Guntur v. Y. Mohan Rao MANU/SC/0074/1976 : [1976]3SCR1046 and N.E. Hero v. Jahan Ara Jai Pal Singh MANU/SC/0048/1972 : [1972]3SCR361 .
5. Shri Nambiar, learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondents, contended that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are intended to remove handicaps and disadvantages suffered by backward class citizens due to social and educational backwardness like the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Therefore, persons who by birth belong to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or Backward Classes alone are entitled to the benefit of Articles 15(4) and 16(4). By marriage, adoption or any other device, viz., by procuring false social status certificates, they are not eligible to avail of protective discrimination for appointment to any office or to a post under the State or admission in educational institution. What is relevant is inadequacy of representation of that class into an office or service under the State. The members belonging to that particular group which is not adequately represented alone are entitled to avail of the protective discrimination. The appellant, having had the advantage of starting life as Syrian Catholic being born in forward class, though she voluntarily married to a backward class citizen, cannot claim the status as a backward class to avail of protective discrimination unless she further pleads and establishes that candidates like her suffered all the handicaps and disadvantages having been born as backward class citizens or Scheduled Castes or scheduled Tribes. Mere recognition of and acceptance by the community, after her marriage is not relevant for the purpose of availing of the benefit of Articles 15(4) and 16(4). Acceptance may be only for recognition as a legally wedded wife of a backward class citizen and nothing more. He distinguished the ratio of Mohan Rao's case (supra) contending that the parents of Mohan Rao initially belonged to the Scheduled Castes but later they converted into Christianity. On reconversion Mohan Rao was accepted to be a member of the Scheduled Castes and, therefore, his admission as a reserved candidates was upheld by this Court. The ratio therein cannot be extended to all the situations and has to be confined to special facts established in that case. As to Hero case, the submission was that it is not relevant for our purpose.
6. The rival contentions give rise to the question of harmonising the conflict between the personal law and the constitutional animation behind Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution. The concepts of "equality before law" and "equal protection of the laws" guaranteed by Article 14 and its species Articles 15(4) and 16(4) aim at establishing social and economic justice in political democracy to all sections of the society, to eliminate inequalities in status and to provide facilities and opportunities not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people belonging to Scheduled Castes (for short "Dalits')', Scheduled Tribes (for short Tribes') and Other backward Classes of citizens (for short OBCs) to secure adequate means of livelihood and to promote with special care the economic and educational tt interests of the weaker sections of the people, in particular, Dalits and Tribes so as to protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. By 42nd Constitution (Amendment) Act, secularism and socialism were brought in the Preamble of the Constitution to realise that in a democracy unless all sections of the society are provided facilities and opportunities to participate in political democracy irrespective of caste, religion, and sex, political democracy would not last long. Dr. Ambedkar in his closing speech on the draft Constitution stated on November 25, 1949 that "what we must do is not to be attained with mere political democracy; we must make, our political democracy a social democracy as well, Political democracy cannot last unless there lies on the base of it a social democracy". Social democracy means "a way of life which recognises liberty, equality and fraternity as principles of life". They are not separate items in a trinity but they form union of trinity. To diversify one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. Articles 15(4) and 16(4), therefore, intend to remove social and economic inequality to make equal opportunities available in reality. Social and economic justice is a right enshrined for the protection of society. The right to social and economic justice envisaged in the Preamble and elongated in the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of the Constitution, in particular, Articles 14 15 16 21 38 39 and 46 of the Constitution, is to make the quality of the life of the poor, disadvantaged and disabled citizens of the society, meaningful. Equal protection in Article 14 requires affirmative action for those unequals by providing facilities and opportunities. While Article 15(1) prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, Article 15(4) enjoins upon the State, despite the above injunction and the one provided in Article 29(2), to make special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Dalits and Tribes. Equally, while Article 16(1) guarantees equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State, Article 16(4) enjoins upon the State to make provision for reservation for these sections which in the opinion of the State are not adequately represented in the services under the State. Article 335 of the Constitution mandates that claims of the members of the Dalits and Tribes shall be taken into consideration in making appointments to services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union or of a State consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of administration. Therefore, this Court interpreted that equal protection guaranteed by Articles 14 15(1) and 16(1) is required to operate consistently with Articles 15(4) 16(4) 38 39 46 and 335 of the Constitution, vide per majority in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India MANU/SC/0104/1993 : [1992] Supp. 3 SCC 217 known as Mandal case. In other words, equal protection requires affirmative action for those unequals handicapped due to historical facts of untouchability practiced for millennium which is abolished by Article 17; for Tribes living away from our national mainstream due to social and educational backwardness of OBCs.
