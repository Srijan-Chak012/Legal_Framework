JUDGMENT
1. Application for extension of time is rejected. It is surprising that the Government of India in the Ministry of Environment is not taken note of the environmental degradation which has resulted because of the operations of tanneries in the 5 districts of Tamil Nadu. A time-schedule has been fixed in the judgment. The first step in the process is the appointment of an authority Under Section 3(3) of the Environmental Protection Act. Any delay in the constitution of the Authority would further delay the execution of the total scheme envisaged under the Judgment. We gave enough time to the Government of India to constitute the Authority. A bald affidavit has been filed. Nothing has been brought to our notice why during the period of 4 weeks the Government of India could not constitute the Authority. We re-iterate that the directions of this Court shall have to be complied with. To come up on October 4, 1996 for further proceedings in the matter.
