JUDGMENT
1. The appeals have been preferred as against the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Allahabad, Bench at Lucknow, deciding two Writ Petitions by the common order dated 08.02.2006 questioning the change in master plan 2021 and land acquisition proceedings. The facts, in short, unfolds that the area in question was reserved for green belt in the master plan that was prepared in the year 1995. A fresh master plan was prepared and approved on 31.03.2005. The area was changed from green belt to residential one on the prayer being made by the Lucknow Development Authority. Surprisingly the act was done in tandem, the date on which the master plan was modified, the area in question was changed from green belt to the residential one. On the same day, a notification had been issued Under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short 'the Act'). A corrigendum was issued on 05.05.2005 and later on 24.10.2005 that shows the notification had been issued Under Sections 4(1), 17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act in utter haste. A declaration Under Section 6 was issued on 24.10.2015.
2. The area to be acquired in the notification Under Section 4 was 266.661 Hectares for the purpose of expansion of Gomti Nagar at Lucknow. Out of this, 203.189 Hectares area belongs to individual landowners and rest of the area belonged to the Government. The declaration Under Section 6 was confined to the area 203.189 Hectares. The total area reserved for the green belt in the master plan was 266.661 Hectares.
3. A Writ Petition was preferred in the month of June, 2005. The High Court had passed an interim order of status quo with respect to the disputed property. The Petitioner in the Writ Petition had prayed for the relief to issue a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing of master plan especially challenging the legality and validity of a portion of the Master Plan of 2021 converting green belt area to residential. Adarsh Samuhik Sahkari Krishi Samiti Limited owned land in area 10.102 Hectares whereas Lal Bahadur owned 0.512 Hectares. The prayer was also made in the Writ Petition to quash the notification issued Under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act invoking the urgency provision.
4. The Lucknow Development Authority had issued a Public Notice on 23.02.2005 inviting objections/suggestions to the Draft Master Plan by 04.03.2005. In the Draft Master Plan, the disputed land was shown for parks and open spaces/green belt. After considering the objections/suggestions, the Master Plan was finalised, which was later approved by the Government on 31.03.2005, and notified on 09.04.2005.
5. It was urged on behalf of the Petitioners that the Master Plan of 2021 was in violation of the mandatory provisions of Section 11 of U.P. Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973 (in short "the Act of 1973"). The area could not have been changed from greenbelt/open spaces to the area reserved for development of residential colonies. The action was based on malice in law. It was unreasonable, arbitrary and tantamount to the colourable exercise of power, and it was contrary to reports of the expert's Committee. The action was in violation of Articles 21 and 48A of the Constitution of India. The authorities were guilty of acting contrary to the public interest and duty to protect the environment that was their constitutional duty and tantamount to removing of oxygen filled lung spaces that are absolutely necessary for the healthy environment for the inhabitants of Lucknow. There is a paucity of such spaces, it would result in ecological imbalance and hazardous to the health. The notification Under Section 4 of the Act was bad in law; inquiry Under Section 5-A could not have been dispensed with.
6. The stand of the Lucknow Development Authority in the reply was that Writ was not maintainable. The Master Plan had been notified after following the due process of the Act of 1973. The objections were duly invited. Thereafter, the Master Plan had been finalised. The total 278 objections were received from the Public against the Draft Master Plan. The Lucknow Development Authority suggested that land in village Ujariyaon was required for the purpose of residential use that was accepted. It was also submitted that earlier the area had been acquired for Gomti Nagar in the year 1983 which had been developed and for its expansion some more area was necessary. As the Government Under Section 4 of the Act had issued such notification and due procedure of law had been followed for preparation of Master Plan duly considering the various aspects particularly the ever increasing population. Other facts were also denied.
7. The High Court by the impugned judgment and order had dismissed the Writ Petitions. It was held that the precaution has been taken to preserve the environment and safeguarding of forests and wildlife as required by Article 48-A of the Constitution of India. There was no violation of provisions of Articles 21 and 48-A of the Constitution of India. The provision for urgency had been rightly invoked. Aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the High Court, the appeals have been preferred.
8. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant has urged that the change in the Master Plan from green belt to residential one was illegal, unconstitutional and change was made to oblige the builders. The Respondents have acted in tandem even before the final publication of the Master Plan 2021 in the Gazette on 09-04-2005. The notification Under Sections 4(1) read with Section 17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 had been issued and on the same day, the Master Plan was finalised by the State Government. Though, Master Plan was notified on 09.04.2005 but issuance of notification Under Sections 4, 17(1) and 17(4) on 31-03-2005 clearly indicated that it was the colourable exercise of power to oblige some builder and there was some invisible hand acting illegally to usurp the land as well as to destroy the green belt. Learned Counsel has submitted that inquiry Under Section 5-A of the Act could not have been dispensed with as it provides a safeguard in consonance with Article 300-A. Learned Senior Counsel has referred to the decision of this Court in Ram Dhari Jindal Memorial Trust v. Union of India, MANU/SC/0269/2012 : (2012) 11 SCC 370 : AIR 2012 SC 1878. He has prayed for the quashing the notifications as well as the part of Master Plan 2021 changing green belt to residential one.
9. Learned AAG appearing on behalf of the State of U.P. and learned Counsel appearing for the Lucknow Development Authority have at the outset stated that the entire area of 266.661 Hectares has been converted to "Janeshwar Mishra Park" and that this Court had permitted vide order dated 14.07.2010. It is being used as the park it shall continue to be used as park without putting up any construction and it would not be converted to residential area in future. They have further stated that the area shall not be converted for any other purpose. Its use shall not be changed in future.
They have contended that as the Appellant did not file any objections to the proposed Master Plan they were precluded from filing Writ applications in the High Court as need for expansion of Gomti Nagar urgency was felt and provisions of 17(1), 17(4) of the Act had been invoked but ultimately the residential scheme has been dropped. Possession had been taken. A large number of incumbent had collected the compensation as per award that has been passed. Hence, no case for interference is made out in changed circumstances due to development of the park.
10. Firstly, we take up the issue regarding change of the area from green belt to a residential one. It is not in dispute that the area had been reserved for green belt in 1995 Master Plan. We find that it was absolutely unwarranted exercise of power on the part of the Respondents to change the area from green belt to residential one in Master Plan 2021. Learned Senior Counsel is right that some invisible hand was behind the change that is why the Respondents acted in tandem and the notification Under Section 4 of the Act had been issued on the same very day on which the Master Plan had been finalised by the State Government. Even before the master plan was notified in the Gazette 09-04-2005, under the Act of 1973, the notification had been issued Under Section 4 of the Act on 31.03.2005. We wholly agree with the submission of the learned Counsel on behalf of the Appellant that change of the area from green belt to residential was, in fact, in flagrant violation of the provisions contained in Articles 21 and 48-A and also 51-A(g) of the Constitution. Articles 48-A and 51-A(g) are extracted hereunder:
48-A. Protection and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and wild life. The State shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country.
51A(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures.
11. Law is well-settled in this regard. In Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and Ors. MANU/SC/0426/1991 : (1991) 4 SCC 54 : AIR 1991 SC 1902, this Court had considered the question whether area reserved for a public park can be converted for other purposes. The State Government by the subsequent order had allotted the area reserved for public parks to a Medical Trust, for the purposes of constructing a hospital. This Court has laid down the importance of open spaces and public parks in the said case and held that said spaces are a "gift from people to themselves". It observed that:
23. The scheme is meant for the reasonable accomplishment of the statutory object which is to promote the orderly development of the City of Bangalore and adjoining areas and to preserve open spaces by reserving public parks and playgrounds with a view to protecting the residents from the ill-effects of urbanisation. It is meant for the development of the city in a way that maximum space is provided for the benefit of the public at large for recreation, enjoyment, 'ventilation' and fresh air. This is clear from the Act itself as it originally stood. The amendments inserting Sections 16(1)(d), 38A and other provisions are clarificatory of this object. The very purpose of the BDA as a statutory authority is to promote the healthy growth and development of the City of Bangalore and the area adjacent thereto. The legislative intent has always been the promotion and enhancement of the quality of life by the preservation of the character and desirable aesthetic features of the city. The subsequent amendments are not a deviation from or alteration of the original legislative intent, but only an elucidation or affirmation of the same.
24. Protection of the environment, open spaces for recreation and fresh air, playgrounds for children, promenade for the residents and other conveniences or amenities are matters of great public concern and of vital interest to be taken care of in a development scheme. It is that public interest which is sought to be promoted by the Act by establishing the BDA. The public interest in the reservation and preservation of open spaces for parks and playgrounds cannot be sacrificed by leasing or selling such sites to private persons for conversion to some other user. Any such act would be contrary to the legislative intent and inconsistent with the statutory requirements. Furthermore, it would be in direct conflict with the constitutional mandate to ensure that any State action is inspired by the basic values of individual freedom and dignity and addressed to the attainment of a quality of life which makes the guaranteed rights a reality for all the citizens.
25. Reservation of open spaces for parks and playgrounds is universally recognised as a legitimate exercise of statutory power rationally related to the protection of the residents of the locality from the ill effects of urbanisation.
