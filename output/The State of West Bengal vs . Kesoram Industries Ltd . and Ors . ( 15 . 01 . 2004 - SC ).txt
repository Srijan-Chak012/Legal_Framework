Case Note:
West Bengal primary education Act, 1973, West Bengal Rural Employment and production Act, 1976 - West Bengal Taxation laws (Amendment) Act 1992 - Cess Act, 1980 - Levy of cesses on coal bearing land, on tea plantation land and on removal of brick earth - Constitutional Validity of - Cesses on coal bearing land, levied in exercise of power conferred by State legislation struck down by a division bench of Calcutta on ground of levy being ultra vires Legislative competence of state High Court - High Court holding that Cess could not be said to be on land so as to be covered by Entry 49 Schedule II - Writ petition filed by Bengal brickfield owner's Association challenging levy of cesses on removal of brick earth - Challenge to coal matters, brick earth matters on ground of State Legislature not being competent to legislate - Validity - Amendments incorporated by the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1992 w.e.f. 1.4.1992 into the provisions of the West Bengal Primary Education Act 1973 and the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act 1976 classified land into three categories: (i) coal-bearing land, (ii) mineral bearing land (other than coal-bearing land) or quarry and (iii) land other than the preceding two categories - These three classifications were well-defined classifications by reference to user or quality and nature of product which it was capable of yielding - The cess is levied on the land - Method of quantifying the tax was by reference to the annual value thereof - It is well-known that one of the major factors contributing to the value of the land is what it produces or is capable of producing - Merely because the quantum of coal produced and dispatched or the, quantum of mineral produced and dispatched from the land is the factor taken into consideration for determining the value of the land, it does not become a tax on coal or minerals - Being a tax on land it was fully covered by Entry 49 in List II - Assuming it to be a tax on mineral rights it would be covered by Entry 50 in List II - Taxes on mineral rights lie within the legislative competence of the State Legislature "subject to" any limitation imposed by Parliament by law, relating to mineral development - As far as mineral rights were concerned, by reference to Entry 50 of List II and Entry 54 in List I, Central Legislation not casting any limitations on State Legislature power to tax mineral rights and impugned Cess being covered by Entries 49 and 50 of list II, West Bengal taxation laws (Amendment) Act 1992 held intra vires constitution - As far as tea matters were concerned, held that land forming part of tea estates was a well defined classification and impugned Cess was a tax on tea bearing land and covered by Entry 49 in List II - Brick earth being a minor mineral, impugned Cess by reference held applicable to brick earth as well and held to be covered by Entries by 49 or 50 in List II - Levy of Cesses on coal bearing land, on tea plantation land and on removal of brick earth, held intra vires being with legislative competence of State legislature
U.P. Special Area Development Authorities Act, 1986 - Section 35 - Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, 1957 - U.P. Mine and Mineral Concession Rules, 1963 - Minor Minerals - Levy of Cess on - Constitutional validity - Levy of Cess on minor minerals by State of U.P challenged on ground of being ultra vires legislative competence of State Legislature - High Court holding that SADA Act, SADA Cess rules and levy of Cess were constitutionally valid under entry 5 in list II - Validity - There is nothing wrong in state legislation being Cess by way of tax so as to generate its funds - Although it is termed as "Cess on mineral right" impact thereof falls on land delivering minerals - Hence levy of Cess also falls within scope of Entry 49 of List II - Levy of Cess on minor minerals held intra vires
Constitution of India, 1950 - Articles 245, 246 - Relevant principles for interpretation of entries classified and grouped into three lists of Seventh Schedule of Constitution - Taxation - Distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence - Complete separation of taxing power of union and States under Article 246 - Legislations in field of taxation and economic activities need special consideration and are to be viewed with larger flexibility in approach - Taxation - Measure of levy not suggestive of nature of tax
Constitution of India, 1950 - Tax legislation - Conflict between powers of union and State - Analytical examination of Constitutional scheme - Federal character of constitution - Constitution having bias towards center vis a vis states - Conflict in entries in three lists in seven Schedule - Doctrine of pith and substance - Applicability of

1. This batch of matters, some appeals by special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution and some writ petitions filed in this Court, raise a few questions of constitutional significance centering around Entries 52, 54 and 97 in List I and Entries 23, 49, 50 and 66 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India as also the extent and purport of the residuary power of legislation vested in the Union of India. Cesses on coal bearing land, levied in exercise of the power conferred by State Legislation, have been struck down by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court. In exercise of the same power conferred by State legislation whereunder cesses were levied on coal bearing land, cesses have also been levied on tea plantation land which are the subject-matter of writ petitions filed in this Court. The Bengal Brickfield Owners' Association have also come up to this Court by filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, laying challenge to the same cesses levied on the removal of brick earth. These three sets of matters arise from West Bengal. The High Court of Allahabad has upheld the constitutional validity of Cess levied in the State of U.P. on minor minerals which decisions are the subject-matter of civil appeals filed under Article 136 of the Constitution. For the sake of convenience, we would call these matters, respectively as (A) 'Coal Matters', (B) Tea Matters', (C) 'Brick Earth Matters', and (D) 'Minor Mineral Matter'. Inasmuch as the basic constitutional questions arising for decision in all these matters are the same, all the matters have been heard analogously.
2. We would first set out the facts in brief and so far as relevant for appreciating the Issues arising for decision and thereafter deal with the same.
(A) Coal Matters
3. A Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court has, vide its judgment dated 25.11.92 reported as Kesoram Industries Ltd. (Textiles Division) v. Coal India Ltd.. MANU/WB/0016/1993 : AIR1993Cal78 , struck down certain levies by way of Cess on coal as unconstitutional for want of legislative competence in the State Legislature. Feeling aggrieved, the State of West Bengal has come up in appeal by special leave

------
By order of the Governor
R. BHATTACHARYYA,
Secy, to the Govt. of West Bengal,"
6. It is the constitutional validity of the amendment in the two legislations, given effect to from 1,4,92, which was successfully impugned in the High Court and Is sought to be restored in these appeals.
7. The High Court has placed reliance mainly on two decisions of this Court, namely India Cement Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors., (Seven-Judges Bench decision) and Orissa Cement Ltd. v. State of Orissa and Ors. 1991 Supp.(1) SCC 430 (Three-Judges Bench decision). In both these decisions the levy of cess impugned therein was struck down as unconstitutional. The High Court of Calcutta has held that the levy impugned herein is similar to the one held ultra vires the legislative competence of the State twice by the Supreme Court, and hence the same was liable to be struck down.
8. In the opinion of the High Court, the case is assessed and computed on the basis of value of coal produced from the coal bearing land, and coal bearing land has bean defined to mean land having one or more seams of coal comprising the area of a coal mine. Therefore, it is the production of coal from a coal mine which is the basic event for the levies and the cess is to be levied at 35 per centum of the 'annual value of the coal bearing land', which, as per definition, is directly related to the value of coal produced from the coal mines. The value of the coal has been related to the price. Explanation to Clause (1) of Section (2) of the 1976 Act, as amended by the 1992 Act, makes the real nature of the levy clearer by providing that where different prices are, prevailing on the relevant date for different grades or qualities of coal, the value of coal of each grade or quality shall be relevant, The High Court has concluded that the cess cannot be said to ba on land so as to be covered by Entry 49 in Schedule II. On behalf of the writ petitioner--respondents, the judgment of the High Court has been supported on similar grounds as were successfully urged before the High Court and which we shall presently deal with. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the appellant-State of West Bengal has submitted that having regard to the real nature of the levy, it clearly falls within the legislative field of Entry 49 in List II.
(B) Tea matters
9. The writ petitions in which the validity of the levy of cesses relatable to tea estates is involved has an interesting legislative history behind it. By virtue of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1981, amendments were effected in the provisions of the West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973, and the West Bengal Rural Employment And Production Act, 1976. Cesses were sought to be levied upon certain lands and buildings in the State for raising funds for the purpose of providing primary education throughout the State and to provide for employment in rural areas. Different rates in respect of lands, coal mines and other mines on annual basis were provided. Tea estates were carved out as a separate category and a separate rate was prescribed therefore as under.
"Section 4(2) : The rural employment cess shall be levied annually -
(a) in respect of lands, other than a tea estate, at the rate of six paise on each rupee of development value thereof;
(aa) in respect of a tea estate-at such rate, not exceeding rupees six on each kilogram of tea on the Dispatches from such tea estate of tea grown therein, as the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, fix in this behalf :
Provided that in calculating the Dispatches of tea for the purpose of levy of rural employment cess, such Dispatches for sale made at such tea auction centers as may be recognized by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette shall be excluded:
Provided further , that the State Government, may fix different rates on Dispatches of different classes of tea.
Explanation. - For the purpose of this section, 'tea' means the plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze as well as all verities of the product known commercially as tea made from the leaves of the plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze, including green tea and green tea leaves, processed or unprocessed."
Sub-section (4) was introduced in Section 4 which empowered the State Government to exempt "such categories of dispatches or such percentage of dispatches from the liability to pay the whole or any part of the rural employment cess or reduce the rate..." . By another amendment effected in 1982, the first proviso to Clause (aa) In Section 4(2) was omitted. Several notifications were-issued by the Government from time to time as contemplated by Section 4(2).
10. The constitutional validity of the abovesaid amendment was challenged successfully in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd. and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Ors. - MANU/SC/0086/1989 : [1989]179ITR91(SC) . The decision is by a Bench of two learned Judges. The levy of cess having been struck down, the State became liable to refund the cess already collected and the relevant schemes which were financed by the cresses so collected came under jeopardy. The West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 was enacted, which is under challenge herein.
11. Section 2 of the impugned Act contains amendments to West Bengal Primary Education Act while Section 3 sets out the amendments to West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act, 1976. As mentioned hereinbefore, it would be enough to notice the gist of the amendments made in one of the two Acts of 1973 or 1976, since the amendments in both are identical.
12. Clause (aa) in Sub-section (2) of Section 4 was omitted with effect from 1.4.1981. After Sub-section (2), Sub-section (2-A) was introduced with retrospective effect from 1.4.1981. Subsection (2-A) reads :
(2-A) The rural employment cess shall be levied annually, on a tea estate at the rate of twelve paise for each kilogram of green tea leaves produced in such estate.
Explanation. - For the purposes of this sub-section, Sub-section (3) and Section 4-B-
(i) "green tea leaves' shall mean the plucked and unprocessed green leaves of the plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze;
(ii) "tea estate' shall mean any land used or Intended to be used for growing plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze and producing green tea leaves from such plant, and shall include land comprised in a factory or workshop for producing any variety of the product known commercially as 'tea' made from the leaves of such-plant and for housing the persons employed in the tea estate and other lands for purposes ancillary to the growing of such plant and producing green tea leaves from such plant."
13. Clause (a) in Sub-section (3) was also substituted which had the effect of making the owner of the tea estate liable for the said cess. The other provisions require the owner of the tea estate to maintain a true and correct account of green tea leaves produced in the tea estate. Sub-section (4) was also substituted. The substituted Sub-section (4) empowered the State Government to exempt from the cess such categories of tea estates producing green tea leaves not exceeding two lakh fifty thousand kilograms and located in such area as may be specified in such notification. Section 4-5 contains the validation clause, it says that any cess collected for the period prior to the said Amendment Act shall be deemed to have been validly levied by it and collected under the Amended Act. Any assessment made or other proceedings taken in that behalf for assessing and collecting the said tax were also to be deemed to have been taken under the Amended Act.
14. Goodricke Group Ltd. and Ors. filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India in this Court. The levy of cesses under both the State enactments as amended by the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 was impugned. A few matters raising a similar challenge and pending in various High Courts were also withdrawn to this Court. All the matters were heard and decided by a three-Judges Bench of this Court, vide judgment dated November 25, 1994, reported as Goodricke Group Ltd. and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Ors. - (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 707. The decision of this Court in India Cement Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. (1930) 1 SCC 12 (seven-judges Bench) and Orissa... Cement limited v. State of Orissa and Ors. (1991) Suppl. 1 SCC 430 (three-Judges Bench) were cited before the three-judges Bench in Goodricke. Both the decisions were distinguished and the constitutional validity of the 1989 amendments was upheld. The writ petitions were dismissed,
15. It appears that a similar cess was levied by a pan materia provision enacted by the State Legislature of Orissa as the Orissa Rural Employment, Education and Production Act, 1982, The cess was on land bearing coal and minerals. Challenge to the constitutional validity of such cess was successfully laid before this Court, and the Orissa Legislation was struck down as unconstitutional and ultra vires the competence of the State Legislature in State of Orissa. v. Mahanadi Coal Fields Limited MANU/SC/0361/1995 : [1995]3SCR639 decided on April 21, 1995.
16. On 30.3.1996 a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India has been filed in this Court laying challenge to the constitutional validity of the very same amendments which were unsuccessfully impugned in the Goodricke's case.
17. The writ petitioners in the Tea Matters have in their petition stated a few grounds in support of the relief sought for. However, a perusal of the grounds reveals that in substance the challenges is only one, i.e., the decision in Goodricke runs counter to the view of the law taken by Seven-Judges Bench in. India Cement and three-Judges Bench in Orissa Cement; Goodricks was rightly not followed in Mahanadi Coal Fields; rather Mahanadi Coal Fields has whittled down the authority of Goodricke and that being the position of law the impugned cess is ultra vires the power of the State Legislature and deserves to be pronounced so. In short, the same challenge as was laid and turned down in Goodricke, is reiterated drawing support from the decisions of this Court previous and subsequent to and seeks the overruling of Goodricke.
(C) Brick-Earth Matters
18. The Bengal Brickfield Owners' Association, being a representative body of the persons engaged in the activity of brick manufacturing and owning brickfields as also one of the brickfield owners, have joined in filing a writ petition before this Court wherein the constitutional validity of the very same provisions as contained in the Cess Act, 1880, the West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 and the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act, 1976 ( both as amended by the Bengal Taxation Laws Amendment Act, 1992) has been put in issue, as has been subjected to challenge by the coal mine owners and the tea estate owners disputing the levy of cess allegedly on coal and tea. The grounds of challenge, briefly stated, are three in number: firstly, that brick-earth is a minor mineral to which the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act, 1957, applies and by virtue of the declaration made by Section 2 of the Act by reference to Entry 54 in Schedule I of the Constitution, the field relating to such minor minerals is entirely covered by the Central Legislation and hence the State Legislations are not competent to levy the impugned cess; secondly, that the levy is on that dispatch of minor minerals fee sale, while the process of manufacturing bricks does not involve any dispatch of the brick-earth inasmuch as the brick-earth is consumed then and there, on the brickfield itself, in the process of manufacturing of bricks, and there being no dispatch of brick-earth, the cess is not leviable; and thirdly, that the State Government is not empowered to levy any cess on either the extraction of brick-earth or on the dispatch of brick-earth. In support of these three grounds, it is further submitted that the same quantity of brick-earth is subjected by Central Legislation to payment of royalty which is a tax, and the same quantity of brick-earth is sought to be levied with cess which is incompetent so far as the State Legislature is concerned. The writ petition places reliance on the decisions of this Court in India Cement Ltd. and Ors. (supra), Orissa Cement Ltd. (supra) and Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd. and Ors. (supra). Some of the members of the petitioner association were served with demand notices. The relief sought for in the petition is striking down of the relevant provisions of the three State Legislations as ultra vires the Constitution and quashing of the demand notices. The reason for filing the petition in this Court, as stated in the writ petition, is that the provisions sought to be impugned herein have already been declared ultra vires by the High Court of Calcutta in relation to 'tea', an appeal against which decision has been filed in this Court and by an interim order the operation of the judgment of the High Court was stayed.
19. According to the respondents, the cess sought to be levied by the impugned State Legislation is in the nature of fee and not tax. The purpose of levying fee, as stated in the Preamble to the relevant legislation, is rendering different services to the society and for public benefit. The cesses have been levied by the State Government for securing of welfare to the people by the State as is enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution of India by providing communication facilities, removal of illiteracy and rural employment to the poor living below the poverty line. The impugned legislations levying the cess, do not encroach upon the field covered by the Central legislation, The brick-kiln owners extract the brick-earth as an item of trade. From every 100 c.ft. of brick-earth which weighs 5 metric tones, 1382 bricks are manufactured. The dispatch of 1382 bricks means the dispatch of 100 c.ft. or 5 metric tones of brick-earth. A brickfield owner performs dual functions: firstly, he extracts a quantum of brick-earth from the quarry, and secondly, he dispatches the same for manufacture of bricks in the some quarry-field. The brickfield owner is an extractor of brick-earth and also a manufacturer of bricks. The element of dispatch is kept hidden. That is why the cess is now assessed on annual dispatches. Dispatch, in the context of brick-earth, means removal of brick-earth from one place to another which may be within the same complex and for domestic or captive use or consumption. In any case, the removal of brick-earth involved in the process cannot escape assessment.
(D) Minor Mineral Matters
20. This batch of appeals puts in issue the judgment dated 1.3.2000 delivered by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court (reported as Ram Dhani Singh v. Collector, Sonbhadra and Ors. - MANU/UP/0368/2000 : 2000(2)AWC1761 ), upholding the constitutional validity of a cess on mineral rights levied under Section 35 of the U.P. Special Area Development Authorities Act, 1986, read with Rule 3 of the Shakti Nagar Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997 (herein referred to briefly as "SADA Act' and 'SADA Cess Rules' respectively). There was a bunch of 73 writ petitions filed in the High Court which have all been dismissed. The challenge is being pursued in this Court by ten writ petitioners through these appeals by special leave.
21. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh promulgated U.P. Ordinance No. 15 of 1985, which was repealed by U.P. Special Area Development Authorities Act, 1986 (U.P. Act No. 9 of 1986), containing identical provisions as were contained in the preceding Ordinance. The said Act received the assent of the President of India on 19.3.1986 and was published in U.P. Gazette of that day. Section 35 of the Act provides as under :
"35. Cess on mineral rights.-
(1) Subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development, the Authority may impose a cess on mineral rights at such rate as may be prescribed.
(2) Any Cess imposed under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the State Government and shall be leviable with effect from such data as may be appointed by the State Government in this behalf."
22. On 24.2.1997, in exercise of the power conferred by Section 35 of the Act, the Governor made the Shakti Nagar Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997, which were published on the same day in the U.P. Gazette and came into force. Rule 2(b) and Rule 3(1) and (2), relevant for our purpose, are extracted and reproduced hereunder :
"2. In these rules, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context--
(a) xxx xxx xxx
(b) "Mineral Rights" means rights conferred on a lessee under a mining lease granted or renewed for mining operations in relation to Minerals (providing operation for raising, winning or extracting coal) as defined in the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 (Act No. 67 of 1957"
"3.(1) The Authority may, subject to Sub-rules (2) and (3) impose a cess on mineral rights on such minerals and minor minerals and at such rates are specified below :
MINERAL/MINOR MINERAL MINIMUM RATE MAXIMUM RATE
(1) Cess on Coal Rs.5.00 (per ton) Rs.10.00 (per ton)
(2) Cess on Stone, Coarse Sind/Sand Rs.2.00 (Per Cubic metre) Rs.5.00 (Per Cubic metre)
(2) The rates shall not be less than the minimum rates or more than the maximum rates specified in Sub-rule (1) and shall be determined by the Authority by a special resolution which shall be subject to confirmation by the State Government."
In exercise of the power conferred by the Act and the Rules, the State Government proceeded to levy cess and take steps for recovery thereof by serving notices and issuing citations on the several stone crushers (which the appellants are), who extract stone as mineral and convert the same into metal by a process of crushing. They filed the writ petitions disputing the levy and the demand by the State Government.
23. On behalf of the writ-petitioners, the SADA Cess Rules as also the legislative competence of the State Legislature to enact Section 35 of the SADA Act were challenged on the ground that the MMDR Act, 1957, having been enacted containing a declaration under Section 2 as contemplated by Entry 54 of List-I and the Act being applicable to Sonbhadra failing within the State of U.P. as well, the State Legislature was denuded of its power to enact the impugned law and levy the impugned cess. It was also submitted that the impugned cess would have the effect of adding to the royalty already being paid and thereby increasing the same, which was ultra vires the power of the State Government as that power was exercisable only by the Central Government.
24. The High Court has held the SADA Act, the SADA Cess Rules and the levy of cess thereunder within the competence of State Legislature by reference to Entry 5 in List II.
Reference to Constitution Bench
25. Since the appeals referable to coal matters and the writ petition referable to tea matters raised common issues, the cases were taken up for hearing together. On 12.10.1999, the conflict amongst several decisions of this Court was brought to the notice of the three-judges Bench hearing the matter which passed the following order :
"Great emphasis has been placed by learned counsel for the State of West Bengal upon the judgment of a Bench of three learned Judges in Goodricke Group Ltd. and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Ors. [1995 Suppl. (1) SCC 707]. Quite apart from the fact that there are pending proceedings in this Court seeking to reconcile the judgment in Goodricke with that in State of Orissa and Ors. v. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. and Ors. MANU/SC/0361/1995 : [1995]3SCR639 , we find some difficulty in accepting as correct the view taken by Goodricke, particularly having regard to the earlier decision (of a Bench of two learned Judges) in Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of West Bengal MANU/SC/0086/1989 : [1989]179ITR91(SC) . We think, therefore, that these matters should be heard by a Constitution bench.
The papers and proceedings may, accordingly, be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for appropriate directions."
26. The brick-earth matters were also clubbed with the abovesaid matters for hearing.
27. The impugned judgment of the High Court of Allahabad in Minor Mineral Matters has placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Goodricke Group Ltd. and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Ors. - (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 707. The correctness of the said decision was in issue in Civil Appeal Nos. 1532-33 of 1993 and batch matters and hence these appeals were also directed to be placed before the Constitution Bench for hearing.
28. This is how the four sets of matters have been listed before and heard by the Constitution Bench.
Relevant Entries and principles of interpretation
29. Before we proceed to examine the merits of the submissions and counter submissions made on behalf the parties, it will be useful to recapitulate and summarise a few principles relevant for interpreting entries classified and grouped into the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The law is legion on the point and the principles which are being briefly stated hereinafter are more than settled. These principles are referred to in the several decisions which we shall be referring to hereinafter. So far as the principles are concerned they have been followed invariably in all the decisions, however diverse results have followed based on facts of individual cases end manner of application of such principles to the facts of those cases.
30. The relevant entries to which reference would be required to be made during the course of this judgment are extracted and reproduced herein:-
"SEVENTH SCHEDULE
(Article 246)
List I - Union List
52. Industries, the control of which by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.
54. Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.
96. Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List, but not including fees taken in any court.
97. Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those Lists.
List II - State List
23. Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the Union.
49. Taxes on lands and buildings.
50. Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.
66. Fees in respect of any of the matter in this List, but not including fees taken in any court."
31. Article 245 of the Constitution is the fountain source of legislative power. It provides - subject to the provisions of this Constitution. Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India, and the Legislature of a State may make Saws for the whole or any part of the State. The legislative field between the Parliament and the Legislature of any State is divided by Article 246 of the Constitution. Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in Seventh Schedule, called the 'Union List'. Subject to the said power of the Parliament, the Legislature of any State has power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III, called the 'Concurrent List'. Subject to the abovesaid two, the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II, called the 'State List'. Under Article 248 the exclusive power of Parliament to make laws extends to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List. The power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in the Concurrent List or State List vests in Parliament. This is what is called the residuary power vesting in Parliament. The principles have been succinctly summarized and restated by a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court on a review of the available decisions in Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors., - MANU/SC/0392/1983 : [1985]154ITR64(SC) . They are-
(1) the various entries in the three Lists are not 'powers' of legislation but 'fields' of legislation. The Constitution effects a complete separation of the taxing power of the Union and of the States under Article 246. There is no overlapping anywhere in the taxing power and the Constitution gives independent sources of taxation to the Union and the States.
(2) In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated, the question of repugnancy between law made by Parliament and a law made by the State Legislature may arise only in cases when both the legislations occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and a direct conflict is seen. If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other, the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union law.
(3) Taxation is considered to be a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence. There is a distinction made between general subjects of legislation and taxation. The general subjects of legislation are dealt with in one group of entries and power of taxation in a separate group. The power to tax cannot be deduced from a general legislative entry as an ancillary power.
(4) The entries in the List being merely topics or fields of legislation, they must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense. The words and expressions employed in drafting the entries must be given the widest possible interpretation. This is because, to quote V. Ramaswami, J., the allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but by way of a mere simplex enumeration of broad categories. A power to legislate as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expanse the legislations touching incidental and ancillary matters.
(5) Where the legislative competence of a Legislature of any State is questioned on the ground that it encroaches upon the legislative competence of Parliament to enact a law, the question one has to ask is whether the legislation relates to any of the entries in Lists I or III. If it does, no further question need be asked and Parliament's legislative competence must be upheld. Where there are three Lists containing a large number of entries, there is bound to be some overlapping among them. In such a situation the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to determine as to which entry does a given piece of legislation relate. Once it is so determined, any incidental trenching on the field reserved to the other Legislature is of no consequence. The Court has to look at the substance of the matter. The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes expressed in terms of ascertaining the true character of legislation. The name given by the Legislature to the legislation is immaterial. Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole, to its main objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions. Incidental and superficial encroachments are to be disregarded.
