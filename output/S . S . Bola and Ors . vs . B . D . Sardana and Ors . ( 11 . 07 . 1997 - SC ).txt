1. Application/s for impleadment allowed. These appeals and transfer cases are wrapped up of complex facts interwoven with diverse principles in service jurisprudence, compounded by legislative intervention impinging upon judicial review by enacting Act 20 of 1995 to regulate the conditions of service of persons appointed to the Haryana Service of Engineers, Class-I, Public Works Department (Buildings and Roads Branch). (Public Health Branch) and (Irrigation Branch) respectively. The said Act 20 of 1995 (for short, the 'Act') came into force with effect from November 13, 1995. It amended and repealed the Haryana Service of Engineers, Class-I, PWD (Buildings and Roads Branch), (Public Health Branch) and (Irrigation Branch) Rules, Irrigation Branch by Ordinance 6 of 1995. The latter repealed the Punjab Service of Engineers, Class-I, PWD (Roads and Buildings Branch), (Public Health Branch) Rules 1960 and (Irrigation Branch) Rules, 1961 issued under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution (for short, 'the Rules'). This Act was given retrospective effect from 1st day of November, 1966, the date on which the State of Haryana was formed by bifurcation of the former State of Punjab.
2. The cases have their chequered history. On the date of formation of the State of Haryana, the respective services were manned by and constituted often promotee officers allotted from the former State of Punjab. All of them were from Haryana (erstwhile Punjab) Class-II subordinate officers. The respective repealed Rules constituted Haryana Services of Engineers, Class-I, PWD consisting of Buildings and Roads Branch, Public Health Branch and Irrigation Branch respectively which were governed by the statutory repealed Rules. The class-I service of Engineers consists of the Executive Engineers, Superintendent Engineers and Chief Engineer. Subsequently, the post of Engineer-in-Chief was added in the respective branches. The Assistant Executive Engineers are the feeder cadre to the said Class-I Service; they are drawn by way of direct recruitment. Haryana (erstwhile Punjab) Class II, Subordinate service was also feeder channel for appointment by promotion, as Executive Engineers and thereafter as Superintendent Engineer or Chief Engineers or Engineer in Chief, as the case may be. The respective repealed Rules and the Act contained a provision for appointment by transfer from any other State or Central Service; however, none was appointed from that feeder channel. Therefore, these cases do not concern that group and it has now become a dried up source. As stated, as on November 1, 1966, ten posts, each manned by promotee personnel, were allotted to the respective Branches of Haryana Services of Engineers, Class-I. The Rules provided the ratio of recruitment in Buildings and Roads and Public Health branches, viz., 50% to the direct recruits and 50% to the promotees. In the Irrigation Branch, for the first eight years, the ratio between promotees and direct recruits was 75% and 25% thereafter, it became 50 : 50 as in other two branches. Though the Rules provided for creation of the cadre posts every year Under Article 3 read with Appendix-A of the respective repealed Rules, the State failed to demarcate the cadre posts; nor did it operate the services in strict conformity with the respective quotas as per the repealed Rules. As usual, it led to the acrimony between the promotees and the direct recruits; their inter se seniority, which is a perennial and unending source of litigation, has again given rise to these appeals and transferred writ petitions filed in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana.
3. The usual endless acrimony for seniority, between promotees and direct recruits, when the former are interjected into the service due to lapse of regular direct recruitment and their passage into Class-I service, is being met with turbulence for faculty transposition channels. The unsuccessful writ petitions filed in the High Court by promotees were dealt with in appeals by this Court concerning Buildings and Roads and Public Health Branches in, A.N. Sehgal v. Raje Ram Sheoram MANU/SC/0333/1991 : (1992) Supp. (1) SCC 304 : AIR 1991 SC 1406 and S.L. Chopra v. State of Haryana MANU/SC/0274/1991 : (1992) Supp. (1) SCC 391 : (1991) AIR SCW 1028. Therein, Dr. B.D. Sardana of Public Health Branch was one of the contesting Respondents. The third stage now intermingles with the chains from the promotees in Irrigation Branch which undoubtedly was not dealt with on the previous occasion. They came to be linked with the two Branches and together dealt with in the Ordinance and the Act as well as by the High Court. The respective repealed Rules stand now wiped out from the statute after the coming into force of the Act with retrospective effect, i.e., from November 1, 1966.
4. Instead of dealing again with the repealed Rules of the respective Branches, it would be appropriate, advantageous and of necessity to reiterate from, Sehgal MANU/SC/0333/1991 : AIR 1991 SC 1406 and Chopra's cases 1991 AIR SCW 1028 cases the findings and mandamus issued by this Court. The judgments now stand repealed by legislative judgment from ex-facie tanner under the Act. Though the facts are baffling, questions of law are diverse and the intricacies of judicial review, and require careful examination for resolution of the controversy. The galaxy of the senior counsel representing the promotees and the counsel for the State made their bee-line Herculean efforts to sustain the constitutionality of the Act and the consequential seniority determined on its basis. On ultimate analysis, after deep probe and independent investigation, we find that the valiant arguments of the respective counsel for the State and the promotees, if given acceptance would lead to destruction of the vitality of judicial review, resultant husk would remain for the successful party; and the mandamus issued by this Court would bear no fruit. Thus, the revelation of emerging results given us deeper anxiety to have a pervasive fresh look into the legal setting and constitutional contours; and to set out our sojourn to tread on delicate track. Founding fathers of the Constitution fondly entrusted, expressly, to this Court "as worthy Judges," in the language of Dr. K.K. Munshi, the doyen of the Bar and prominent member of the Constitution, as per the solemn oath taken, to uphold the Constitution, to dispense justice according to constitution and the law without fear of favour, affection or ill-will. This case calls for decision on the delicate task of judicial review of legislative Act and we solemnly undertake hereunder to discharge that onerous constitutional duty.
5. As stated earlier, it is not necessary to reiterate the relevant provisions of the repealed statutory Rules governing Buildings and Roads Branch and Public Health Branch since they have been extensively dealt with by a Bench of two Judges (to which one of us, K.R.S., J., was a member) in, Sehgal MANU/SC/0333/1991 : AIR 1991 SC 1406 and Chopra 1991 AIR SCW 1028, cases relieving us of the task to tread the path once over; it would be sufficient to record those findings and the mandamus issued with directions contained therein for compliance. At the outset, we may State that when the Bench dealt with the matter in Sehgal and Chopra's cases, a pointed question was put to the counsel then appearing, whether it would be advantageous to decide the question of law without determination of the cadre posts and fixation of the inter se seniority between promotees and direct recruits. The learned Counsel for the parties, including the State, informed this Court of their difficulty in understanding the scope of the Rules and requested this Court to declare the law on the Rules and leave it to the State to determine inter se seniority on the basis of the law so declared. Acceding to that request, the Division Bench considered all the relevant Rules, declared the law and gave the directions to the State Government and the mandamus for compliance thereof. In, Sehgal's case, MANU/SC/0333/1991 : 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 304 : AIR 1991 SC 1406, in para 6 at page 309, (of Supp. SCC): at p. 1410 of AIR, this Court had observed that the service shall comprise Assistant Executive Engineers, Executive Engineers, Superintending Engineers and Chief Engineers. "Rule 3(2) read with Appendix 'A' enjoins the State of Haryana to determine the cadre strength of service each year, Appendix 'A' lays down the procedure for determination of the cadre strength of service. The senior posts includes Executive Engineers and above while the junior scale posts include Assistant Executive Engineers." be it cadre or ex-cadre posts. "Rules 6 and 7 prescribe qualifications and method of appointment by direct recruitment. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 7 states that appointment to the service shall be made according to the number of vacancies to be filled up by direct recruitment strictly in the order of merit." Rule 11(1) regulates and operates probationary period. On satisfactory completion of the probation by operation of Rule 11(3)(a), the direct recruits get confirmation into the service and those whose service is found unsatisfactory become liable to be discharged from service. As stated earlier, the post of Assistant Executive Engineers was a junior scale post which is integral to the service and Rule 12(3) prescribes the year of allotment as the calendar year in which the order of appointment is issued by the Government.
6. In para 7, it is stated that Rule 2(1) defines appointment to service which includes an appointment made according to the terms and provisions of the rules to an officiating vacancy or to ex-cadre post provided that an officer so appointed shall not be deemed to have become a member of that service as defined in Rule 2(12). The Assistant Executive Engineer, though appointed to an ex-cadre post, since he is appointed by direct recruitment, becomes a member of the service from the date of his appointment as the Assistant Executive Engineer; though he performs the duty of an ex-cadre post awaiting appointment to a regular post, on satisfactory completion of the probation and its confirmation, the seniority dates back to the date of appointment. Therefore, the date of his appointment as Assistant Executive Engineer and his becoming a member of the service remain unalterable. It was held in paragraph 8 as under:
A reading of the rules clearly indicates that an Assistant Executive Engineer appointed by open competition to a substantive vacancy in a cadre post and put on probation is a member of the service. Equally each Assistant Executive Engineer recruited by open competition and appointed to ex-cadre post and put on probation and to having successfully completed his probation and awaits appointment to a cadre, post would also become a members of the service.
7. In paragraph 9, it was held that "Para 11(b) of Appendix 'A' read with Rule 3(2) while determining the cadre strength of the services it adumbrates creation and appointment of Assistant Executive Engineers (direct recruit) to an ex-cadre junior scale post in each year. Therefore, in a given situation, a direct recruit appointed to an ex-cadre post, cannot be kept in lurch until he is appointed to a cadre post so as to become a member of the service. Obviously to avoid such a hiatus, Rule 2(12)(a) was introduced. The main part of Rule 2(12)(a) declares that an appointee substantively to a cadre post i.e., permanent post is a member of the service. The inclusive definition brings out that an officer appointed by direct recruitment and put on probation in an ex cadre post, who having successfully completed probation and awaits appointment to a cadre post, is also a member of the service." "The words 'and such an officer' 'directly appointed' would obviously be referable to an Assistant Executive Engineer directly appointed to an ex-cadre post who is entitled to be placed on probation and on successful completion awaits appointment to a cadre post. By operation of the definition clause, he also becomes the member of the service from the date of initial appointment. This view is further fortified by the definition of the appointment to the service in Rule 2(1) which says that appointment to the service includes an appointment made, according to the terms and provisions of these rules, to an officiating vacancy or to an ex-cadre post. Rule 2(7) says that direct appointment means appointment by open competition but excludes 'promotee' or 'transferee'. So a promotee promoted to an officiating vacancy or an ex-cadre post does not become a member of the service unless he is appointed substantively to a cadre post. We, therefore, hold that a direct recruit appointed to an ex-cadre post alone is a member of the service even while on probation and Rule 2(12)(a) applies to them and it does not apply to a promotee from Class II service."
8. In para 12, it was held that "It is settled law that prescription of quota for recruitment from different sources is constitutionally a valid rule." Para 13 dealt with quota of 50% to the promotees as Executive Engineer, Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer and it was found in paragraph 12 that 50% of the post as Executive Engineer, Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer shall be occupied only by direct recruit Assistant Executive Engineers. It may be made clear at this juncture that the entire Haryana Service of Engineers Class-I, PWD compositely consists of Executive Engineers, Superintending Engineers, Chief Engineers and Engineer-in-Chief in the respective Branches. It was, therefore, held that 50% quota between direct recruits and promotees would apply to all posts of Executive Engineers. Superintending Engineers and Engineer-in-Chief unlike in some other State/Central services. Executive Engineers, Superintending Engineers etc. are not each a separate cadre.
In para 19 at page 317, of MANU/SC/0333/1991 : 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 304 : at p. 1415 of AIR 1991 SC 1406, it was held as under:
19. It is settled law that appointment to a post in accordance with the rules is a condition precedent and no one can claim appointment to a post or promotion, as of right, but has a right to be considered for promotion in accordance with the rules. Appointment by promotion or direct recruitment, therefore, must be in accordance with the rules so as to become a member of the service in a substantive capacity. Seniority is to be fixed in accordance with the principles laid down in the rules.
9. The rights of prornotees were considered in para 20 thus:
20. Rule 8 prescribes procedure for appointment by promotion from Class II service. Rule 9(2) states that promotion would be made by selection on the basis of merit and suitably in all respects and no member of the service shall have any claim, to such promotion as a matter of right by mere seniority. The committee as constituted Under Rule 8 shall prepare the list of officers considered fit for promotion in the order of merit and on approval by the Public Service Commission, the State Government shall appoint the persons from the list in the order in which the names have been placed by the Commission. Appointment by promotion may be made Under Rule 8(12) to an ex-cadre post or to any post in the cadre in an officiating capacity from the list prepared as aforesaid. On promotion, as per Rule 11(1), officer shall be on probation for a period of one year, but if the officer had been officiating as an Executive Engineer the period of officiation would be counted towards probation. Rule 11(4) provides that on satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the Government confirms the officiating promotee and "appoint him in a substantive capacity on a cadre post provided the post is available to him". If no cadre post is available, the officer has to wait for an appointment to the cadre post.
