Prior History / High Court Status:
From the Judgment and Order dated 19.05.2011 of the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh) in Writ Petition No. 5698/2008 (MANU/MP/0391/2011)
Disposition:
Appeal Dismissed
Case Note:
Property - Determination of lease - Section 23-A (2) of Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam, 1973 - Division Bench dismissed Writ Petition filed by Appellants seeking to challenge change of land-use from 'commercial' to a 'regional park' of a parcel of land which had been allotted to Appellants in town planning scheme, and also decision of State Government that concerned land be utilized only after inviting fresh tenders - Hence this Appeal - Whether document of allotment of land in question was in any way a lease or a license - Held, document of allotment merely granted a permission to use concerned parcel of land in a particular manner, and without creating any interest therein - Since document of allotment was a license and not one creating any interest, provision of renewal contained therein could not be read as laying down a mandatory requirement - Besides, Clause 14 of document of license clearly stated that in event of violation of any of terms and conditions on part of licensee, decision of Chairman of IDA was final - Para 7 of show cause notice in fact stated that necessary action to establish Children's Amusement Park had not been taken since half of land had remained undeveloped, and it amounted to violating conditions of license - Doctrine of promissory estoppel could not be permitted to be invoked on such a background - Hence document would have to read as granting a license, and not a lease - Thus there was no error in impugned judgment of High Court - Appeal dismissed.

Property - Allotment of land - Change of land-use - Quashing of Notification - Section 23-A (2) of Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam, 1973 - Whether Notification dated 19th November, 2003 could be quashed and set aside - Held, Section 23-A of Act permitted modification of provisions in development plan by following due procedure of law as laid down therein - In instant case, a Notification had been issued earlier on 9th March, 2001 inviting objections to proposed modification - Appellants were heard with respect to these objections, and thereafter Notification dated 19th November, 2003 had been issued approving proposed modification - It was contended on behalf of Appellants that modification was a motivated one - Appellants submitted that under modification, a parcel of land in nearby vicinity which was earlier reserved for a green area, was now being permitted for a commercial use, whereas user of land which was marked for Children's Amusement Park, was being changed to a regional park - This was with a view to accommodate constructions which had come up on other parcel of land in vicinity - Appellants had not joined any of those parties for whose benefit this change had been allegedly made - In absence of factual basis, Court was precluded from going into plea of malafides - Further land meant for Children's amusement park was hardly put to full use - Moreover this entire parcel of land of about 7 acres was not utilized, and since it was an open parcel of land, there was nothing wrong in State Government deciding to retain it as an open parcel of land, and to change land-use thereof from commercial to a regional park - Therefore Notification could not be faulted on that count either - Thus there was no error in impugned judgment of High Court - Appeal dismissed.

JUDGMENT
H.L. Gokhale J.
1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal by special leave seeks to challenge the judgment and order dated 19.5.2011 rendered by a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissing the Writ Petition bearing No. 5698/2008 filed by the Appellants herein. The said petition sought to challenge the change of land-use from 'commercial' to a 'regional park' of a parcel of land which had been allotted to the Appellants in the town planning scheme of Indore, and also the decision of the State Government that the concerned land be utilized only after inviting fresh tenders.
3. The first Appellant herein is a Company registered under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, and the second Appellant is its Managing Director. The Respondent No. 1 to this appeal is the State of Madhya Pradesh through its Principal Secretary, Department of Housing and Environment, Bhopal, whereas the Respondent No. 2 is the Director of Town and Country Planning of Madhya Pradesh. The third Respondent to this appeal is Indore Development Authority ("IDA" for short) through its Chairman, whereas the fourth Respondent is the same Authority through its Chief Executive Officer. Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel has appeared for the Appellants. Shri Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel has appeared for the first two Respondents, and Ms. Vibha Datta-Makhija, Learned Counsel has appeared for Respondent No. 3 and 4.
Facts leading to this appeal:-
4. During November 1991 to February 1992, IDA floated tenders through advertisements for setting up of an amusement park on a parcel of land owned by it situated in village Bhamori-Dubey. The concerned land admeasured about seven acres comprising of survey Nos. 91 part, 92/1, 93/1, 93/2, 94/1, 94/2, 95/1, 95/2, 96/1, 96/2, 152, 155 part, 157, 159, 160, 162, 163, 164 part, 165 part and 166 part and was situated within Scheme No. 54. There is no dispute that under the then subsisting Development Plan the designated land-use of these survey Nos. was 'commercial'. It is the case of the Appellants that though they applied in pursuance to the advertisement, and though the Appellants were the most eligible, IDA arbitrarily delayed the acceptance of their tender. This led the Appellants to file an earlier writ petition in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh bearing M.P. No. 313/1992 which was allowed by the High Court. Consequently, the Appellants were allotted this parcel of land for the establishment of a Children's amusement park.
5. Accordingly, IDA granted a license to the Appellants, the terms and conditions of which were as follows:
LICENSE
(FOR AMUSEMENT CENTRE)
Dated 6.5.1994
This license is granted to Shri Ramesh Mangal son of Shri Manikchand Mangal age 48 years, resident of 8/2, New Palasia, Indore, Managing Director, M/s Mangal Amusement Park Pvt.

SIGNATURE OF LICENSEE
6. It is the case of the Appellants that they submitted the plans, maps and drawings for necessary construction, and thereafter started using the concerned parcel of land as amusement park.
7. It so transpired that sometime in December 1999, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 i.e. the State and the Town Planning Dept. initiated the process of modification of the Development Plan. In that process it was proposed to change the user of this parcel of land from 'commercial' to 'regional park' (i.e. a green area). The Chairman of IDA however, wrote in that context to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on 7.12.1999 that such a change was not desirable, since the use of the concerned land was already secured for a specified purpose in the master plan. The State Govt. however proceeded to issue a notification on 9.3.2001 under Section 23-A (2) of Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam, 1973 (M.P. Act for short) proposing the change of the land-use from 'commercial' to 'regional park', and inviting objections thereto. The Appellants did raise objections against the proposed modification which were heard by the Principal Secretary to the Govt. of Madhya Pradesh on 23.8.2001.
8. It is the case of the Appellants that they wanted to put up a banquet hall and an amusement club on this parcel of land, and therefore sought the requisite permission from IDA. IDA in fact passed a resolution bearing No. 133 on 8.5.2003 recommending grant of such permission though subject to the conditions mentioned therein. The Chief Executive Officer of IDA accordingly wrote to the Principal Secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Govt. on 27.5.2003 for grant of this permission, and consequently for the increase in the license fee. The State Govt. however wrote back on 23.9.2003 declining the request, and asking IDA to invite the tenders afresh for the re-allotment of the plot (the Appellants however contend that there is a contrary note on the files of the Respondents dated 29.9.2003 recommending the proposed use). That apart, ultimately the Madhya Pradesh Govt. issued the notification approving the change in the land-use from 'commercial' to a 'regional park' on 19.11.2003. It is this letter dated 23.9.2003 and notification dated 19.11.2003 which were challenged by the Appellants by filing Writ Petition No. 5698/2008 in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.
9. This letter dated 23.9.2003 reads as follows:
M.P. Government
Housing and Environment Department
Ministry
Letter No. H-3-107/3/32 Bhopal Date 23.09.2003
To, The Chief Executive Officer Indore Development Authority Indore, M.P.

Ref: Your letter No. 6314 dated 23.05.03.
Please take reference of the letter referred above, by which Authority had sought permission from Govt. for proposal on land allotted by Authority on lease 1994.
2. It has been established from the documents made available by the Authority that proceedings by the Authority have not been in accordance with the rules and there has been lack of transparency. Therefore, it is not possible to give permission on this proposal of Authority.
3. It is directed to Authority that it utilize the land in question only after issuing fresh notification inviting tenders.

11. The Appellants point out that thereafter also the stand of IDA was different from that of the concerned department as reflected in the Note sheet of IDA dated 3.2.2005. Yet, ultimately it accepted the view-point of the State Govt., and issued a show cause notice to the Appellants on 8.1.2007 alleging various breaches of the terms and conditions of allotment. In para 7 and 8 thereof, it was alleged as follows:
7. You have not taken action to establish Children's Amusement Park on the land allotted violating conditions of license. Half of the land is still undeveloped, vacant and without any use given after 12 years of allotment.
8. Application for the construction of Amusement Club, Banquet Hall on the land allotted, given by you establishes that you do not want to run activities relating to Children's Amusement Park on the land allotted.
The Appellants were, therefore, asked to show cause as to why the license of land allotted to them should not be cancelled.
12. It is the further case of the Appellants that although this show cause notice was issued on 8.1.2007, the Chairman of IDA once again wrote to the Govt. on 29.11.2007 asking it to retain the land-use of this particular parcel of land as commercial. The State Govt. however proceeded to bring the modification into force with effect from 1.1.2008. It is at this stage that the above writ petition No. 5698 of 2008 was filed with the following prayers:
(a) to strike down Section 23-A of Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam 1973 (which prayer was however not pressed),
(b) to quash the notification dated 19.11.2003, and
(c) to quash Govt.'s letter dated 23.9.2003 (which prayer was added later on).
13. Contentions of the rival parties
The principle submission of the Appellants was three-fold:
(a) the document of allotment of the concerned parcel of land to the Appellants was a document of lease and not simply a license, and that the Appellants were entitled to the renewal thereof,
(b) the Appellants had made good investment onto the concerned parcel of land, and they had their legitimate expectations. Consequently, the Respondents were bound by the doctrine of promissory estoppel to renew the allotment,
And
(c) the decision to change the land-use was a malafide one for the benefit of another party which had its parcel of land in the vicinity, where the land-use was changed from the previous one which was 'regional park', to 'commercial'. The change of use of land of the parcel allotted to the Appellants was effected to set off the resultant reduction in green area, and to justify the change of land-use of the parcel of land allotted to the other party.
14. The petition was opposed by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on the one hand, and by Respondents No. 3 and 4 by filing their replies. They contended principally as follows:
(a) the concerned document of allotment was clearly a document of license, and not that of lease. In any case, by that time the period of license having expired after the lapse of 15 years, the Appellants did not have any case for renewal particularly when they had not put to use half of the land for the purpose for which it was allotted, and when in fact they wanted to use it for another purpose by putting up a banquet hall therein.
(b) Inasmuch as, the document of allotment was a license which was valid only for 15 years, there was no question of the Appellants having a legitimate expectation for a renewal beyond 15 years. The Respondents had not promised any such renewal to the Appellants to enable them to avail of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
(c) The modification in the development plan was effected after considering all relevant factors and not for obliging anybody. No material in support of their allegation had been produced by the Appellants. The change was effected after following the due process of law, viz. inviting suggestions and objections, and hearing the concerned parties. The change cannot be faulted on that count either.
15. The petition was heard by a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court which dismissed the same by its judgment and order dated 19.5.2011, after hearing the counsel for all the parties. This judgment is under challenge in the present appeal.
16. Consideration of the rival submissions
The principle question to be considered is as to whether the document of allotment of land dated 6.5.1994 was in any way a lease or a license. As far as a lease is concerned, Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, defines it as follows:
105. Lease defined.-A lease of immoveable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms.
Lessor, lessee, premium and rent defined. - The transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is called the premium, and the money, share, service or other thing to be so rendered is called the rent.
As far as a license is concerned, the same is defined under Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882, as follows:
52. "License" defined. -Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.
From these two definitions it is clear that a lease is not a mere contract but envisages and transfers an interest in the demised property creating a right in favour of the lessee in rem. As against that a license only makes an action lawful which without it would be unlawful, but does not transfer any interest in favour of the licensee in respect of the property.
17. The issue concerning the distinction between lease and license came up for consideration before this Court in Associated Hotels of India v. R.N. Kapoor reported in MANU/SC/0168/1959 : AIR 1959 SC 1262. In para 27 of his judgment, Subba Rao,J. (as he then was) observed therein as follows with respect to lease:
27. There is a marked distinction between a lease and a license. Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defines a lease of immovable property as a transfer of a right to enjoy such property made for a certain time in consideration for a price paid or promised. Under Section 108 of the said Act, the lessee is entitled to be put in possession of the property. A lease is therefore a transfer of an interest in land. The interest transferred is called the leasehold interest. The lessor parts with his right to enjoy the property during the term of the lease, and it follows from it that the lessee gets that right to the exclusion of the lessor....
Thereafter, the learned Judge referred to the definition of license, then observed as follows:
Under the aforesaid section, if a document gives only a right to use the property in a particular way or under certain terms while it remains in possession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a license. The legal possession, therefore, continues to be with the owner of the property, but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for the permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property. There is, therefore, clear distinction between the two concepts. The dividing line is clear though sometimes it becomes very thin or even blurred.
