ORDER
1. This miscellaneous application is by a mining lessee in the Boon Valley area whose right to mining came to an end in view of the judgment of this Court on 30th of August, 1988 with effect form 30th September, 1988. He had applied for review of the judgment out the same was rejected on December 1, 1988, whereafter the present petition has been filed with a prayer that on grounds of justice, enquiry and compassion he may be permitted to continue mining operations for a period of three months more. Mining in this area excepting in the few cases specifically permitted has been stopped by the judgment of this Court dated 30th of August, 1988. The petitioner had actually been given a month's time to close down his mining activity. Allowing further mining in the area would not be in the environmental and ecological interest.
2. This application is accordingly dismissed.
