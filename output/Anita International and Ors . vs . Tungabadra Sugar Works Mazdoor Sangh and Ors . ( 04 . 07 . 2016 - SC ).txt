Case Note:
Company - Winding up - Auction sale - Jurisdiction - Appeals were filed against order passed by High Court whereby auction sale in question was set aside - Whether order passed by Company Court in High Court, was jurisdictionally and legally impermissible, and as such, was liable to be ignored

Facts:

Two company petitions were filed by Videocon International Ltd. and Tapti Machines Pvt. Ltd., for winding up of Deve Sugars Ltd. before High Court. Deve Sugars Ltd. was running a sugar factory in State of Karnataka. Deve Sugars Ltd. was ordered to be wound up. Official Liquidator took possession of assets of Deve Sugars Ltd. State Bank of Mysore filed Company Applications, in then pending Company Petition, seeking leave of Company Court in High Court to pursue recovery proceedings before Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT). Company Court granted leave "...subject to condition that... no coercive steps are taken against assets of company during or after conclusion of proceedings before Tribunal..." After DRT, issued recovery certificate, State Bank of Mysore filed Company Application with a prayer that bank be permitted to seek execution of recovery certificate. Registry of High Court, at its own, returned above Company Application, by recording an endorsement, that leave of High Court was not necessary. Recovery Officer thereafter proceeded with sale of properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. Respondent-workers' union of Deve Sugars Ltd., objected to execution of recovery certificate by Recovery Officer. Official Liquidator, who was ordered to be impleaded in recovery proceedings initiated by State Bank of Mysore also filed objections. Objections were overruled by Recovery Officer. Respondent-workers' union, then assailed recovery proceedings, before High Court. Videocon International Ltd. and Tapti Machines Pvt. Ltd. also filed Writ Petition before High Court. In above writ petitions, Petitioners assailed sale proceedings before Recovery Officer. Based on a preliminary objection raised by Appellant-Anita International, High Court relegated Petitioners to their remedy under RDB Act, by a common order. Above order was challenged through Writ Appeals before High Court. Writ appeals were dismissed. Respondent-workers' union thereafter preferred AOR No. 15 of 2006 and Videocon International Ltd. filed AOR No. 1 of 2007. In both above matters, a challenge was raised to order passed by Recovery Officer, whereby sale of properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. to Anita International, was confirmed. Company Application were also dismissed. A challenge raised against same, was also dismissed by High Court. Applications filed by Official Liquidator and Ors. were considered collectively (with Company Application Nos. 2740-2742 of 2007) and were rejected by a common order, whereby all applicants were relegated to their remedy of appeal under RDB Act. A challenge raised to above order, by way of an intra-court appeal, was allowed by High Court in impugned order, holding that proceedings before Recovery Officer, including sale of properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. and confirmation thereof, had been conducted in disregard of order of Company Court in High Court passed in Company Applications, seeking leave of Company Court in High Court to pursue recovery proceedings before DRT. Sale and confirmation of properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. in favour of Anita International were accordingly set aside.

Held, while disposing off the appeals:

1. In M.V. Janardhan Reddy case, an order passed by Company Court was held to be binding on Recovery Officer. Based on exactly same consideration that acceptance of bid of Anita International by Recovery Officer, and confirmation of sale in its favour, were clearly impermissible, and therefore, deserve to be set aside.[42]

2. Reference may be made to judgment rendered by this Court in Official Liquidator, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand case. In above judgment it was concluded, that it was not open to Recovery Officer to confirm sale of properties at his own, and such a sale and confirmation of movable or immovable properties made by Recovery Officer, without permission of Company Court, were liable to be set aside. This Court while recording its above conclusion, also expressed, that above issue had nothing to do with proposition, whether an Official Liquidator can approach a Company Court, to seek setting aside of auction and sale conducted by Recovery Officer. Pointed issue canvassed before this Court, at hands of Counsel for Appellants, stood answered against Appellant.[43]

3. For recovery of a debt due to a bank or a financial institution, the concerned bank or financial institution, could legitimately initiate proceedings, by filing a winding up petition before jurisdictional Company Court, or alternatively, intervene in a pending winding up petition. Since, there was no bar restraining a bank or a financial institution from approaching a Company Court, by filing a winding up petition, it was not possible to conclude, that jurisdictional Company Court, was not possessed with determinative authority/competence to entertain a claim raised by such bank or financial institution. Since, Company Court which passed order did not lack jurisdiction, in facts of this case, above order was neither invalid nor void.[44]

4. It was not open either to parties to a lis or to any third parties, to determine at their own, that an order passed by a Court was valid or void. A party to lis or a third party, who considered an order passed by a Court as void or non est, must approach a Court of competent jurisdiction, to had the said order set aside, on such grounds as might be available in law. However, till an order passed by a competent Court was set aside, as was also held by this Court in Official Liquidator, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and Jehal Tanti cases, the same would have force of law, and any act/action carried out in violation thereof, would be liable to be set aside.[45]

5. There was sufficient justification for parties to have approached the Company Court in High Court, for reason that they were seeking enforcement of order passed by Company Court itself. Sale made by Recovery Officer, and its confirmation, were in utter violation of order of High Court grating leave to initiate recovery proceedings, and therefore, concerned parties were justified in approaching High Court at Madras.[48]

6. By order, Company Court in High Court, while granting leave, imposed two conditions. Firstly, Official Liquidator would have to be impleaded by bank in recovery proceedings before DRT. And secondly, no coercive steps would be taken against assets of company during or after conclusion of proceedings before Tribunal. It was not possible to accept, that aforesaid order passed by High Court was an order in personam. Above order had a clear and binding effect on proceedings permitted to be initiated before DRT, and further, that it was equally binding on Recovery Officer. And accordingly, same would also be binding on those claiming through sale proceedings conducted by Recovery Officer. Above order was also binding on Appellant before this Court. Appeals dismissed.[49]
JUDGMENT
J.S. Khehar, J.
1. Leave granted in Special Leave Petition (C) Nos. 7490-7491 of 2014.
2. Two company petitions, i.e., Company Petition Nos. 170 of 1995 and 35 of 1997 were filed by Videocon International Ltd. and Tapti Machines Pvt. Ltd., for winding up of Deve Sugars Ltd. before the High Court of Judicature at Madras. Deve Sugars Ltd. was running a sugar factory in the State of Karnataka. Deve Sugars Ltd. was ordered to be wound up on 16.4.1999. An Official Liquidator was accordingly directed to take possession of the properties of the company-Deve Sugars Ltd. The Official Liquidator took possession of the assets of the company situate at Harige (in District Shimoga, in the State of Karnataka), on 28.9.1999.
3. The State Bank of Mysore had also extended some loans to Deve Sugars Ltd. When Deve Sugars Ltd. defaulted in the repayment of the loans, the State Bank of Mysore filed Original Application Nos. 440 of 1997 and 1300 of 1997, before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Bangalore, (hereinafter referred to as, the DRT, Bangalore) for the recovery of Rs. 22,31,78,558.55. During the course of the instant proceedings, the DRT, Bangalore issued a recovery certificate in the sum of Rs. 8.40 crores. It would be relevant to mention, that the State Bank of Mysore also filed Company Application Nos. 1251-1253 of 1999, in the pending Company Petition No. 170 of 1995, before the High Court at Madras, seeking leave to proceed with the recovery proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore, under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as, the RDB Act).
4. The Company Court in the High Court at Madras, while granting leave to the State Bank of Mysore, passed the following order on 10.3.2000 (while disposing of Company Application Nos. 1251-1253 of 1999):
This company application praying this Court to grant leave to the applicant Bank to proceed and prosecute further O.A. No. 1300 of 1997 filed by them against the Respondent Company in the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Bangalore.
Company Applications coming on this day before this Court for hearing in the presence of Mr. R. Varichandran advocate for the applicant, herein and the official liquidator, High Court, Madras, the Respondent, appearing in person, and upon reading the Judges Summons and affidavit and report of the Official Liquidator filed herein, the Court made the following orders:
Leave is granted subject to the condition that official liquidator is impleaded and no coercive steps are taken against the assets of the company during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the Tribunal.
(Emphasis supplied)
A perusal of the above order reveals, that leave was granted, subject to the condition that the Official Liquidator, was impleaded before the DRT, Bangalore, and further, that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company-Deve Sugars Ltd., during or after the conclusion of proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore.
5. On 1.8.2001, the workers' union of Deve Sugars Ltd. was granted the responsibility to overlook security arrangements of the establishment of Deve Sugars Ltd.
6. Immediately after the DRT, Bangalore, issued the recovery certificate, the State Bank of Mysore moved DCP No. 1912 in Original Application No. 440 of 1997, seeking the disposal of the assets of the company in liquidation, at the hands of the Recovery Officer of the DRT, Bangalore (hereinafter referred to as, the Recovery Officer). Simultaneously, the State Bank of Mysore being conscious of the order passed by the High Court at Madras on 10.3.2000, filed Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, with a prayer that it be permitted to seek execution of the recovery certificate dated 15.5.2002 (for recovering the amounts due to it, from out of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd.). It is relevant to mention, that the aforesaid Company Application No. 1300 of 2003 was not entertained by the Registry of the High Court at Madras. While declining to entertain Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, the Registry of the High Court at Madras, relied upon a judgment rendered by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2536 of 2000 (reported as Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406). While not entertaining Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, the Registry of the High Court recorded the following endorsement:
ORDER
As per order in Civil Appeal No. 2536/00 as reported in 2000(3) SCC 205. Leave is not necessary.
7. Consequent upon the return of Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, it came to be assumed by the State Bank of Mysore, that leave of the High Court, was not required for the sale of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd. Accordingly, the State Bank of Mysore approached the Recovery Officer, for the disposal of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd., in continuation of the recovery certificate issued by the DRT dated 15.5.2002. On the above prayer of the State Bank of Mysore, the Recovery Officer issued a proclamation of sale in Form-13, by following the procedure prescribed under the RDB Act. The auction of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd., in the first instance, was fixed for 1.10.2014.
8. At the instant juncture, the workers' union (Tungabadra Sugar Works Mazdoor Sangh), of Deve Sugars Ltd., approached the High Court of Karnataka, by filing Writ Petition No. 37991 of 2004. Through the above writ petition, the workers' union assailed the recovery proceedings initiated by the State Bank of Mysore, before the Recovery Officer. The workers' union also sought an interim direction from the High Court of Karnataka, to restrain the continuation of the sale proceedings, at the hands of the Recovery Officer, because their salary and provident fund dues, were still payable by Deve Sugars Ltd. The aforesaid prayer was made by asserting, that the workers' union had a preferential claim, as against the claim of the State Bank of Mysore, under the provisions of the Companies Act. A learned single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka, while issuing notice, directed that the sale made by the Recovery Officer would be subject to the final outcome of the writ petition. It would also be relevant to reiterate, that the Official Liquidator was authorized by the High Court at Madras, to take over possession of the properties of the company under liquidation. The Official Liquidator had accordingly taken over possession of the said properties on 28.9.1999. While permitting the State Bank of Mysore to pursue the recovery proceedings against Deve Sugars Ltd. before the DRT, the High Court at Madras, had directed that the Official Liquidator be impleaded as a Respondent before the DRT. The Official Liquidator, had also raised objections to the purported sale by the Recovery Officer (in continuation of the recovery certificate dated 15.5.2002, issued by the DRT). The Official Liquidator sought deferment of the sale proceedings at the hands of the Recovery Officer, Under Section 529A of the Companies Act. It would be relevant to mention, that the objections raised by the workers' union and the Official Liquidator, were overruled by the Recovery Officer.
9. It is also pertinent to mention, that the auction scheduled by the Recovery Officer for 1.10.2004, could not be conducted. Accordingly, a fresh proclamation was issued, for the auction of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd., fixing 11.8.2005 as the date for holding the auction. The rival parties were also permitted to bring their buyers, if there was anyone interested. The reserve price was fixed at Rs. 10 crores. The auction was actually conducted on 11.8.2005. The highest bid was made by Anita International, the Appellant before this Court. The bid of Anita International of Rs. 10.25 crores was accepted. The bidder deposited the bid amount, within the stipulated period. No challenge was raised against the auction conducted on 11.8.2005, within the postulated period of 30 days, as is permissible in terms of the Rules framed under the RDB Act. The Recovery Officer ordered the confirmation of the sale of the auctioned property, after the expiry of statutory period, expressed in Rules 60, 61, and 62 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act (as is applicable to proceedings, before Debts Recovery Tribunals), on 12.9.2005.
10. On 20.9.2005, the Recovery Officer appointed a Receiver, to take possession of the property, sold at the auction. The Court Commissioner allegedly took over possession of some of the properties, and handed over the same to the auction purchaser-Anita International. At the instant juncture, the Appellant-Anita International, filed Company Application No. 1811 of 2005 before the High Court at Madras for removal of the security agency. At the said juncture, Videocon International Ltd. and Tapti Machines Pvt. Ltd. filed Writ Petition No. 26564 of 2005 before the High Court of Karnataka. The above writ petition, and Writ Petition No. 37991 of 2004 (filed by the workers' union) were heard by a learned single Judge, wherein the auction purchaser-Anita International, raised a preliminary objection. It was submitted, that the Petitioners before the High Court had an efficacious alternative remedy, under the RDB Act. It was accordingly prayed, that the Petitioners be relegated to their alternative remedy. Company Application No. 854 of 2006 was filed before the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, wherein a challenge was raised to the sale of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd., at the hands of the Recovery Officer. It would be relevant to mention, that the above two writ petitions were disposed of by the High Court of Karnataka, by a common order dated 27.10.2006. The Petitioners before the Karnataka High Court were allowed to avail of their alternative remedy before the DRT, Bangalore. The above common order dated 27.10.2006 was challenged, by filing Writ Appeal Nos. 2050 and 2051 of 2006. Both the above writ appeals were dismissed on 23.2.2007. Liberty was, however, reserved with Appellants, by permitting them to approach the DRT, Bangalore, by filing appeals. As a matter of abundant caution, the appellate Court ordered, that the DRT, Bangalore, would deal with the controversy, uninfluenced by the orders passed by the High Court.
11. In compliance with, and in continuation of the outcome before the High Court of Karnataka, the workers' union preferred AOR No. 15 of 2006 and Videocon International Ltd. preferred AOR No. 1 of 2007. In the above appeals, a challenge was raised to the order dated 12.9.2005 passed by the Recovery Officer, whereby the sale of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. conducted on 11.8.2005, in favour of Anita International was confirmed. Simultaneously, one N. Ponnusamy, an ex-Director of Deve Sugars Ltd., filed Company Application Nos. 2740-2742 of 2007 before the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, and sought the setting aside of the auction sale dated 11.8.2005, as well as, the confirmation order dated 12.9.2005, after the payment of the consideration amount. The challenge raised by N. Ponnusamy was primarily on the ground that the reserve price of Rs. 10 crore was too low. N. Ponnusamy, also sought transfer of the recovery proceedings, from the DRT, Bangalore, to the High Court at Madras. While entertaining the proceedings initiated by N. Ponnusamy, the High Court by its order dated 24.10.2007, passed an ex parte interim order of stay. Anita International and State Bank of Mysore, filed detailed objections, to the applications filed by the Official Liquidator, as well as, by the aforementioned N. Ponnusamy. All the applications filed in C.A. No. 1811 of 2005 were taken up for consideration, collectively. By a common order dated 3.3.2009, the application filed by the Official Liquidator was dismissed, by holding that the Official Liquidator was a party before the Karnataka High Court (in the proceedings which were disposed of by a common order dated 27.10.2006), and in consonance with the above order, the Official Liquidator was obliged to file an appeal, to challenge the auction sale (dated 11.8.2005), as well as, the order of confirmation (dated 12.9.2005) passed by the Recovery Officer. Likewise, the proceedings initiated by N. Ponnusamy, also did not yield any result. His claim was also rejected on the ground, that he too could have availed of the remedy of filing an appeal, to assail the orders passed by the Recovery Officer. The other applications, which came up for hearing jointly were likewise dismissed, as the said applicants, had already availed of the appellate remedy, before the DRT, Bangalore. As against the above, the application filed by Anita International for possession of the property purchased by way of auction at the hands of the Recovery Officer, was allowed.
12. Dissatisfied with the order passed by the Company Court, the applicants raised a challenge to the order dated 3.3.2009 (passed in C.A. Nos. 1811 of 2005, 854 of 2006 and 2740-2742 of 2007-in Company Petition No. 170 of 1995) by filing O.S.A. Nos. 59-63, 76, 77 and 82 of 2009. The impugned order in the present appeals dated 17.9.2009, was passed by a Division Bench of the Company Court in the High Court at Madras. In arriving at its conclusions, the High Court took into consideration inter alia the following factors:
Firstly, the Official Liquidator had raised objections before the Recovery Officer, in respect of the sale of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. There was nothing to indicate, that the said objections were ever considered by the Recovery Officer. Conversely, the High Court also arrived at the conclusion, that the Official Liquidator who was the custodian of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. (consequent upon the Official Liquidator having taken possession of the assets of the company on 28.9.1999), had failed to effectively protect the property of the company.
Secondly, no material had been placed before the High Court to indicate, that the valuation report (dated 24.3.2002) and the inventory (dated 25.11.2004) were prepared after giving notice to the Official Liquidator, who was undoubtedly in exclusive custody of the properties (which were subject matter of auction).
Thirdly, even after the workers' union had raised objections before the Recovery Officer, no material was placed before the High Court, that there was proper application of mind at the hands of the Recovery Officer, leading to the inference, that the objections were rejected in a casual and lackadaisical manner.
Fourthly, the inspection of the properties of the company under winding up, by the intending purchasers (for the auction sale scheduled on 11.8.2005) was permitted only on the day preceding the date of auction (namely, on 10.8.2005), leading to the inference, that the entire process of auction was a mere formality.
Fifthly, on the advertised date fixed for the auction (on 11.8.2005) the Recovery Officer received only two bids. Despite the above, he closed the bid on 11.8.2005 itself. Insofar as the above two bids are concerned, it was felt, that there was for all intents and purposes only a singular bid. One of the bidders was Anita International-the Appellant herein, and the other bid was by Synergy Steel Ltd.-a sister company of the Appellant-Anita International. In sum and substance therefore, the Recovery Officer closed the bid, after receiving a singular bid.
Sixthly, after holding the auction on 11.8.2005, the Recovery Officer confirmed the sale in favour of Anita International on 12.9.2005. This could not have been done, in view of the order dated 10.3.2000 passed by the High Court at Madras, wherein it was directed, that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company under liquidation, during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore. And as such, the State Bank of Mysore could not have proceeded with, the sale of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd.
13. While dealing with the proposition of law declared by this Court in the Allahabad Bank case MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406, wherein this Court had unambiguously concluded, that the provisions of the RDB Act required, Debts Recovery Tribunals alone, to decide applications for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions. And wherein, it was also held, that the aforesaid responsibility included, the adjudication of the liability of the debtor to banks and financial institutions, as well as, the execution of the recovery certificate by the Recovery Officer. In spite of the above, it was submitted, that the High Court by relying on the judgment in M.V. Janardhan Reddy v. Vijaya Bank MANU/SC/7604/2008 : (2008) 7 SCC 738, and after taking note of the fact, that the State Bank of Mysore had applied to the Company Court of the High Court at Madras, for liberty to recover its dues from Deve Sugars Ltd., by filing Company Application Nos. 1251-1253 of 1999 (in pending Company Petition No. 170 of 1995), and having obtained an order from the High Court dated 10.3.2000, was bound by the same. The High Court also concluded, that the above order dated 10.3.2000 was binding, on the Recovery Officer of the DRT, Bangalore. The High Court also expressed the view, that the order dated 10.3.2000 had unambiguously directed, that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company under winding up. Accordingly, the High Court held, that the State Bank of Mysore could not take advantage of the sale of the assets of the company, or the confirmation thereof at the hands of the Recovery Officer, as the same were in clear violation, of the order (dated 10.3.2000) of the Company Court in the High Court at Madras. Relying on the decision of this Court in the M.V. Janardhan Reddy case MANU/SC/7604/2008 : (2008) 7 SCC 738, the High Court while referring to the findings recorded in paragraph 28 of the above judgment concluded, that since the assets of the company under winding up were under the physical charge of the Official Liquidator, the Official Liquidator ought to have been associated with the auction proceedings, conducted by the Recovery Officer. Since the facts and circumstances of the present case reveal, that the Official Liquidator was not allowed to be associated with the auction proceedings, and even the valuation of the assets, was taken without the knowledge of the Official Liquidator, and further, the objections raised by the Official Liquidator were rejected without due consideration, the Company Court in the High Court at Madras concluded, that the sale of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. by the Recovery Officer on 11.8.2005, was liable to be set aside. So also, the confirmation of the sale, by the Recovery Officer on 12.9.2015.
14. Having concluded as above, the High Court vide the impugned order dated 17.9.2009, directed as under:
Hence the following judgment is made:
(i) The auction sale in question is set aside;
(ii) The auction purchaser is entitled to refund of the monies paid by him towards the auction sale which is now set aside;
(iii) In the interest of all the creditors and also the workers' union, a fresh sale is ordered to be made by the Recovery Officer after following the procedural formalities and after preparation of a fresh valuation done by the panel of valuers appointed by the Company Court with the association of the Official Liquidator and on acceptance of the same by the Company Court in order to ensure a proper price is fetched for the assets of the company in liquidation.
15. While assailing the impugned order passed by the High Court dated 17.9.2009, it was the vehement contention of learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, had no jurisdiction in respect of the proceedings which fell within the legitimate domain of the RDB Act. To canvass the above proposition, learned Counsel placed reliance on a number of judgments of this Court. The submissions advanced in this behalf, are being narrated hereunder:
(i) Reliance was first placed on the Allahabad Bank case MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406. It was pointed out, that the above judgment was rendered on 10.4.2000. And in the above view of the matter, the declared position of law was clear and explicit well before the controversy in hand was determined by the High Court at Madras. From the cited judgment, learned Counsel for the Appellant placed reliance on the following observations:
21. In our opinion, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in regard to adjudication is exclusive. The RDB Act requires the Tribunal alone to decide applications for recovery of debts due to banks or financial institutions. Once the Tribunal passes an order that the debt is due, the Tribunal has to issue a certificate Under Section 19(22) [formerly Under Section 19(7)] to the Recovery Officer for recovery of the debt specified in the certificate. The question arises as to the meaning of the word "recovery" in Section 17 of the Act. It appears to us that basically the Tribunal is to adjudicate the liability of the Defendant and then it has to issue a certificate Under Section 19(22). Under Section 18, the jurisdiction of any other court or authority which would otherwise have had jurisdiction but for the provisions of the Act, is ousted and the power to adjudicate upon the liability is exclusively vested in the Tribunal. (This exclusion does not however apply to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or of a High Court exercising power under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution.) This is the effect of Sections 17 and 18 of the Act.
22. We hold that the provisions of Sections 17 and 18 of the RDB Act are exclusive so far as the question of adjudication of the liability of the Defendant to the Appellant Bank is concerned.
(ii) Execution of certificate by Recovery Officer: is his jurisdiction exclusive.
23. Even in regard to "execution", the jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer is exclusive. Now a procedure has been laid down in the Act for recovery of the debt as per the certificate issued by the Tribunal and this procedure is contained in Chapter V of the Act and is covered by Sections 25 to 30. It is not the intendment of the Act that while the basic liability of the Defendant is to be decided by the Tribunal Under Section 17, the banks/financial institutions should go to the civil court or the Company Court or some other authority outside the Act for the actual realisation of the amount. The certificate granted Under Section 19(22) has, in our opinion, to be executed only by the Recovery Officer. No dual jurisdictions at different stages are contemplated. Further, Section 34 of the Act gives overriding effect to the provisions of the RDB Act......
xxx xxx xxx
The provisions of Section 34(1) clearly state that the RDB Act overrides other laws to the extent of "inconsistency". In our opinion, the prescription of an exclusive Tribunal both for adjudication and execution is a procedure clearly inconsistent with realisation of these debts in any other manner.
24. There is one more reason as to why it must be held that the jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer is exclusive. The Tiwari Committee which recommended the constitution of a Special Tribunal in 1981 for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions stated in its report that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal must relate not only in regard to the adjudication of the liability but also in regard to the execution proceedings. It stated in Annexure XI of its report that all "execution proceedings" must be taken up only by the Special Tribunal under the Act. In our opinion, in view of the special procedure for recovery prescribed in Chapter V of the Act, and Section 34, execution of the certificate is also within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer.

Question of leave and control by the Company Court:
30. Learned Attorney General has, in this connection, relied upon Damji Valji Shah v. LIC of India MANU/SC/0230/1965 : (1965) 3 SCR 665 to contend that for initiating and continuing proceedings under the RDB Act, no leave of the Company Court is necessary Under Section 446. In that case, a Tribunal was constituted under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956. Question was whether Under Section 446 of the Companies Act. 1956, the said proceedings could be stayed and later be transferred to the Company Court and adjudicated in that Court. It was held that the said proceedings could not be transferred. Section 15 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956--which we may say, roughly corresponds to Section 17 of the RDB Act--enabled Life Insurance Corporation of India to file a case before a Special Tribunal and recover various amounts from the erstwhile life insurance companies in certain respects. Section 41 of the LIC Act conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the said Tribunal just like Section 18 of the RDB Act, 1993. There the Company was ordered to be wound up by an order of the Company Court passed Under Section 446(1) on 9-1-1959. The claim was filed by LIC against the Company and its Directors before the Tribunal in 1962. The Respondents before the Tribunal contended that the claim could not have been filed in the Tribunal without the leave of the Company Court Under Section 446(1). This Court rejected the said contention and held that though the purpose of Section 446 was to enable the Company Court to transfer proceedings to itself and to dispose of the suit or proceedings so transferred, unless the Company Court had jurisdiction to decide the questions which were raised before the LIC Tribunal, there was no purpose of requiring leave of the Company Court or permitting transfer......
xxx xxx xxx
31. It may also be noticed that in the LIC Act of 1956, there was no provision like Section 34 of the RDB Act giving overriding effect to the provisions of the LIC Act. Still this Court upheld the exclusive jurisdiction of the LIC Tribunal.....
xxx xxx xxx
71. But the point here is that the occasion for such a claim by a secured creditor (here Canara Bank) against realisations by other creditors (like Allahabad Bank) Under Section 529-A read with proviso (c) to Section 529(1) can arise before the Tribunal only if Canara Bank has stood outside winding-up and realised amounts and if it shows that out of the amounts privately realised by it, some portion has been rateably taken away by the liquidator under Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to Section 529(1). It is only then that it can claim that it is to be reimbursed at the same level as a secured creditor with priority over the realisations of other creditors lying in the Tribunal. None of these conditions is satisfied by Canara Bank. Thus, Canara Bank does not belong to the class of secured creditors covered by Section 529-A(1)(b).
xxx xxx xxx
73. If none of the conditions required for applying Section 19(19) and Section 529-A is therefore, satisfied, then the claim of Canara Bank before the Tribunal can only be on the basis of principles underlying Section 73 Code of Civil Procedure. There being no decree in its favour from any court or from any Tribunal, and the other conditions of Section 73 not having been satisfied, no dividend can be claimed out of monies realised at the instance of Allahabad Bank, even if ' Allahabad Bank is an unsecured creditor.
xxx xxx xxx
76. The next question is whether the amounts realised under the RDB Act at the instance of the Appellant can be straight away released in its favour. Now, even if Section 19(19) read with Section 529-A of the Companies Act does not help the Respondent Canara Bank, the said provisions can still have an impact on the Appellant Allahabad Bank which has no doubt a decree in its favour passed by the Tribunal. Its dues are unsecured. The "workmen's dues" have priority over all other creditors, secured and unsecured because of Section 529-A(1)(a). There is no material before us to hold that the workmen's dues of the Defendant Company have all been paid. In view of the general principles laid down in National Textile Workers' Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan MANU/SC/0025/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 228 there is an obligation resting on this Court to see that no secured or unsecured creditors including banks or financial institutions, are paid before the workmen's dues are paid. We are, therefore, unable to release any amounts in favour of the Appellant Bank straight away.
(Emphasis supplied)
Based on the above decision, it was the contention of learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, had neither the jurisdiction to grant liberty to the State Bank of Mysore to recover its dues from Deve Sugars Ltd. by initiating proceedings under the RDB Act, nor the jurisdiction to interfere with the recovery proceedings by directing that no coercive steps would be taken against Deve Sugars Ltd., during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore. Stated simply, learned Counsel for the Appellant was emphatic, that the order passed by the Company Court in the High Court at Madras (dated 10.3.2000), was jurisdictionally and legally impermissible, and as such, was liable to be ignored.
(ii) Reliance was also placed on Andhra Bank v. Official Liquidator MANU/SC/0203/2005 : (2005) 5 SCC 75. The instant judgment was relied upon to support the conclusions drawn by learned Counsel, while placing reliance on the Allahabad Bank case MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406. Learned Counsel invited our attention to the position expressed in paragraph 19 of the cited judgment, which is extracted hereunder:
19. As regards Point (6), however, this Court at para 76 of the judgment held:
The next question is whether the amounts realised under the RDB Act at the instance of the Appellant can be straight away released in its favour. Now, even if Section 19(19) read with Section 529-A of the Companies Act does not help the Respondent Canara Bank, the said provisions can still have an impact on the Appellant Allahabad Bank which has no doubt a decree in its favour passed by the Tribunal. Its dues are unsecured. The 'workmen's dues' have priority over all other creditors, secured and unsecured because of Section 529-A(1)(a). There is no material before us to hold that the workmen's dues of the Defendant Company have all been paid. In view of the general principles laid down in National Textile Workers' Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan MANU/SC/0025/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 228 there is an obligation resting on this Court to see that no secured or unsecured creditors including banks or financial institutions, are paid before the workmen's dues are paid. We are, therefore, unable to release any amounts in favour of the Appellant Bank straight away.
(Emphasis supplied)
(iii) In chronological order, learned Counsel next relied upon the judgment in Rajasthan State Financial Corporation v. Official Liquidator MANU/SC/1033/2005 : (2005) 8 SCC 190, and drew the Court's attention to the following:
15. In A.P. State Financial Corpn. v. Official Liquidator MANU/SC/0491/2000 : (2000) 7 SCC 291 this Court held that the Company Judge, while permitting the financial corporation to stay outside the liquidation proceedings, rightly imposed conditions to ensure that the Corporation would: (i) discharge its liability due to workers Under Section 529-A of the Companies Act, (ii) inform the Official Liquidator in advance about the proposed sale of properties of the indebted companies, and (iii) would obtain the Court's permission before finalising the tenders. This Court specifically overruled the view taken by the High Court that it was not necessary for the financial corporations to seek permission of the Company Court to stay outside the winding-up proceedings. It was held that Sections 529(1) and 529-A of the Companies Act had overriding effect and the 1985 amendment being later in point of time, the non obstante Clause therein would prevail over the non obstante Clause contained in Section 46-B of the SFC Act.
16. In International Coach Builders Ltd. v. Karnataka State Financial Corpn. MANU/SC/0189/2003 : (2003) 10 SCC 482 this Court considered the correctness of the views expressed by the Karnataka High Court and the Gujarat High Court. This Court held that a right is available to a financial corporation Under Section 29 of the SFC Act against a debtor, if a company, only so long as there is no order of winding up. When the debtor is a company in winding up, the rights of financial corporations are affected by the provisions in Sections 529 and 529-A of the Companies Act. It was also held that the proviso to Section 529 of the Companies Act creates a "pari passu" charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of their dues and makes the Liquidator the representative of the workmen to enforce such a charge. The decision of the Bombay High Court in Maharashtra State Financial Corpn. v. Official Liquidator was approved. The reference to a larger Bench was occasioned by the fact that the decision in Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank was not adverted to in this decision. This decision recognises that, whether a creditor is standing outside the winding up or not, the distribution of the proceeds has to be in terms of Section 529 of the Companies Act read with Section 529-A of that Act in a case where the debtor is a company-in-liquidation. As far as we can see, there is no conflict on the question of the applicability of Section 529-A read with Section 529 of the Companies Act to cases where the debtor is a company and is in liquidation. The conflict, if any, is in the view that the Debts Recovery Tribunal could sell the properties of the company in terms of the Recovery of Debts Act. This view was taken in Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank in view of the Recovery of Debts Act being a subsequent legislation and being a special law which would prevail over the general law, the Companies Act. This argument is not available as far as the SFC Act is concerned, since Section 529-A was introduced by Act 35 of 1985 and the overriding provision therein would prevail over the SFC Act of 1951 as amended in 1956 and notwithstanding Section 46-B of the SFC Act. As regards distribution of assets, there is no conflict. It seems to us that whether the assets are realised by a secured creditor even if it be by proceeding under the SFC Act or under the Recovery of Debts Act, the distribution of the assets could only be in terms of Section 529-A of the Act and by recognising the right of the Liquidator to calculate the workmen's dues and collect it for distribution among them pari passu with the secured creditors. The Official Liquidator representing a ranked secured creditor working under the control of the Company Court cannot, therefore, be kept out of the process.
17. Thus, on the authorities what emerges is that once a winding-up proceeding has commenced and the Liquidator is put in charge of the assets of the company being wound up the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the assets held at the instance of the financial institutions coming under the Recovery of Debts Act or of financial corporations coming under the SFC Act, can only be with the association of the Official Liquidator and under the supervision of the Company Court. The right of a financial institution or of the Recovery Tribunal or that of a financial corporation or the court which has been approached Under Section 31 of the SFC Act to sell the assets may not be taken away, but the same stands restricted by the requirement of the Official Liquidator being associated with it giving the Company Court the right to ensure that the distribution of the assets in terms of Section 529-A of the Companies Act takes place. In the case on hand, admittedly, the Appellants have not set in motion any proceeding under the SFC Act. What we have is only a liquidation proceeding pending and the secured creditors, the financial corporations approaching the Company Court for permission to stand outside the winding up and to sell the properties of the company-in-liquidation. The Company Court has rightly directed that the sale be held in association with the Official Liquidator representing the workmen and that the proceeds will be held by the Official Liquidator until they are distributed in terms of Section 529-A of the Companies Act under its supervision. The directions thus, made, clearly are consistent with the provisions of the relevant Acts and the views expressed by this Court in the decisions referred to above. In this situation, we find no reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court. We clarify that there is no inconsistency between the decisions in Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank and in International Coach Builders Ltd. v. Karnataka State Financial Corpn. in respect of the applicability of Sections 529 and 529-A of the Companies Act in the matter of distribution among the creditors. The right to sell under the SFC Act or under the Recovery of Debts Act by a creditor coming within those Acts and standing outside the winding up, is different from the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the security. The distribution in a case where the debtor is a company in the process of being wound up, can only be in terms of Section 529-A read with Section 529 of the Companies Act. After all, the Liquidator represents the entire body of creditors and also holds a right on behalf of the workers to have a distribution pari passu with the secured creditors and the duty for further distribution of the proceeds on the basis of the preferences contained in Section 530 of the Companies Act under the directions of the Company Court. In other words, the distribution of the sale proceeds under the direction of the Company Court is his responsibility. To ensure the proper working out of the scheme of distribution, it is necessary to associate the Official Liquidator with the process of sale so that he can ensure, in the light of the directions of the Company Court, that a proper price is fetched for the assets of the company-in-liquidation. It was in that context that the rights of the Official Liquidator were discussed in International Coach Builders Ltd. The Debts Recovery Tribunal and the District Court entertaining an application Under Section 31 of the SFC Act should issue notice to the Liquidator and hear him before ordering a sale, as the representative of the creditors in general.
18. In the light of the discussion as above, we think it proper to sum up the legal position thus:
(i) A Debts Recovery Tribunal acting under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act. 1993 would be entitled to order the sale and to sell the properties of the debtor, even if a company-in-liquidation, through its Recovery Officer but only after notice to the Official Liquidator or the Liquidator appointed by the Company Court and after hearing him.
(ii) A District Court entertaining an application Under Section 31 of the SFC Act will have the power to order sale of the assets of a borrower company-in-liquidation, but only after notice to the Official Liquidator or the Liquidator appointed by the Company Court and after hearing him.
(iii) If a financial corporation acting Under Section 29 of the SFC Act seeks to sell or otherwise transfer the assets of a debtor company-in-liquidation the said power could be exercised by it only after obtaining the appropriate permission from the Company Court and acting in terms of the directions issued by that court as regards associating the Official Liquidator with the sale, the fixing of the upset price or the reserve price, confirmation of the sale, holding of the sale proceeds and the distribution thereof among the creditors in terms of Section 529-A and Section 529 of the Companies Act.
(iv) In a case where proceedings under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act. 1993 or the SFC Act are not set in motion, the creditor concerned is to approach the Company Court for appropriate directions regarding the realisation of its securities consistent with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act regarding distribution of the assets of the company-in-liquidation.
(Emphasis supplied)
Relying on the above judgment, learned Counsel for the Appellant emphatically pointed out, that the sale of the properties of a company in liquidation, should not be confused with the distribution of the sale proceeds of the company in liquidation amongst its creditors. It was submitted, that there could be no interference with the right of the Recovery Officer, to sell the assets of the company in liquidation, under the provisions of the RDB Act. But, that had nothing to do with the distribution of the proceeds of the sale. The distribution of the sale proceeds ought to be in consonance with the provisions of the Companies Act, wherein the debtor was a company in liquidation.
(iv) learned Counsel then placed reliance on the M.V. Janardhan Reddy case MANU/SC/7604/2008 : (2008) 7 SCC 738. He invited the Court's attention to the following:
18. So far as the order passed by the learned Company Judge is concerned, it specifically and unequivocally stated that permission of the court should be obtained before sale is confirmed or finalised. That order was passed as early as on 13-8-1999. In an order dated 25-3-2005 also it was expressly mentioned that the sale was subject to confirmation of the court. It was an express condition imposed by the Company Court and as such it was not open to the Recovery Officer to confirm the sale and such order, which was having no authority of law, was rightly set aside by the Company Judge and no grievance could be made.
XXX XXX XXX
22. Our attention has been invited by the learned Counsel to the relevant orders passed by the Company Court from time to time. So far as the order dated 13-8-1999 is concerned, permission to sell the property was granted on certain terms and conditions. They read as under:
(A) The Official Liquidator shall be allowed to have inspection of the properties and assets of the company in liquidation and to take inventory as and when required.
(B) Certified copy of the judgment and decree passed by the Subordinate Judge, Bhongir in OS No. 57 of 1989 dated 24-7-1993 shall be made available to the Official Liquidator without delay.
(C) The certified copy of the order that would be passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Bangalore shall be made available to the Official Liquidator without avoidable delay.
(D) The Petitioner Bank shall file the valuer's report in the court before the properties covered under the mortgage deed are put to sale.
(E) Permission of this Court shall be obtained before the sale of the properties movable or immovable, is confirmed or finalised.
(F) The Petitioner Bank shall undertake to deposit and shall deposit the workmen's dues with the Official Liquidator as and when quantified by him as per the provisions of Section 529-A of the Companies Act.
(G) Whatever surplus remains after the sale and realisation of the dues of the secured creditors and the workmen, as per law, the balance sale proceeds shall be made available to the Official Liquidator for being dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act and the Rules.
xxx xxx xxx
23. An order dated 28-3-2005 in Company Application No. 187 of 2005 was equally clear. It reads as under:
This is an application filed by the nationalised bank seeking permission of this Court to receive the valuation report and also to permit the Bank to effect sale of the properties of the Company under liquidation through the Recovery Officer of the Debts Recovery Tribunal, in terms of the conditions of auction-sale notice dated 2-2-2005.
It is also stated that though sale notice was ordered, no sale was conducted as no permission was obtained from this Court. The Official Liquidator also filed a report reporting that there is no objection as to the proposed auction and also the valuation report as filed by the applicant Company.
Under the above circumstances, the applicant Company is permitted to go ahead with the proposed sale of the assets of the Company under liquidation through public auction. But, however, the said sale, if any effected, shall be subject to the confirmation of this Court. The applicant is accordingly granted permission to effect the sale, but the sale shall be required to be confirmed by this Court.
The application is accordingly disposed of.
The above orders leave no room of doubt that the Bank was permitted to go ahead with the proposed sale of the assets of the Company under liquidation by way of auction but such sale was subject to confirmation by the Company Court. It is therefore, clear that all parties were aware about the condition as to confirmation of sale by the Company Court. It was, therefore, not open to the Recovery Officer to confirm sale. The order passed and action taken by the Recovery Officer was in clear violation of and inconsistent with the specific condition imposed by the Company Court. In our considered opinion, therefore, the Appellant cannot take any advantage of confirmation of sale by the Recovery Officer who did not possess the power to confirm sale.
xxx xxx xxx
27. It is true that when the Company Judge set aside the sale on 17-3-2006, the order was reversed by the Division Bench of the High Court since it was in breach of natural justice. That does not, however, mean that the Company Court could not pass fresh order after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties.
28. In our opinion, the Company Court was right in passing fresh order after hearing the parties. If the Recovery Officer could not have confirmed the sale, obviously all actions taken in pursuance of confirmation of sale, such as issuance of sale certificate, registration of documents, etc. would be of no consequence. Since the Company was in liquidation and Official Liquidator was in charge of the assets of the Company, he ought to have been associated with the auction proceedings, which was not done. This is also clear from the report submitted by the Official Liquidator and on that ground also, the auction-sale was liable to be set aside.
(Emphasis supplied)
Based on the conclusions drawn in the above judgment, it was submitted, that there can be no doubt, that in a matter where the Company Court had passed an order restraining the Recovery Officer confirming the sale, the sale made by the Recovery Officer in execution of the recovery certificate could only have been confirmed with the permission of the Court. Here again, learned Counsel has drawn a fine distinction. It was asserted, that even in the above judgment, this Court had not disputed nor disturbed the exclusive jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer in executing a recovery certificate.
(v) Last of all learned Counsel placed reliance on Official Liquidator, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand v. Allahabad Bank MANU/SC/0234/2013 : (2013) 4 SCC 381, and drew our attention to the following conclusions recorded therein:
23. From the aforesaid verdict, it is vivid that the larger Bench in Rajasthan State Financial Corpn. case approved the law laid down in Allahabad Bank. In fact, it is noticeable that the larger Bench has observed that in Allahabad Bank case, a view has been taken that the RDB Act being a subsequent legislation and being a special law would prevail over the general law, the 1956 Act, but the said argument is not available as far as the SFC Act is concerned.

24. From the aforesaid authorities, it clearly emerges that the sale has to be conducted by DRT with the association of the Official Liquidator. We may hasten to clarify that as the present controversy only relates to the sale, we are not going to say anything with regard to the distribution. However, it is noticeable that Under Section 19(19) of the RDB Act, the legislature has clearly stated that distribution has to be done in accordance with Section 529-A of the 1956 Act. The purpose of stating so is that it is a complete code in itself and the Tribunal has the exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of sale of the properties for realisation of the dues of the banks and financial institutions.

31. The aforesaid analysis makes it luculent that DRT has exclusive jurisdiction to sell the properties in a proceeding instituted by the banks or financial institutions, but at the time of auction and sale, it is required to associate the Official Liquidator. The said principle has also been reiterated in Pravin Gada v. Central Bank of India MANU/SC/1050/2012 : (2013) 2 SCC 101.
32. Once the Official Liquidator is associated, needless to say, he has a role to see that there is no irregularity in conducting the auction and appropriate price is obtained by holding an auction in a fair, transparent and non-arbitrary manner in consonance with the Rules framed under the RDB Act.
XXX XXX XXX
34. We have referred to the said passage from Delhi High Court Bar Assn. case, for the purpose of highlighting that an appeal lies to DRT challenging the action of the Recovery Officer. In the case at hand, the Official Liquidator was not satisfied with the manner in which the auction was conducted and he thought it apposite to report to the learned Company Judge who set aside the auction. Needless to emphasise, the Official Liquidator has a role under the 1956 Act. He protects the interests of the workmen and the creditors and, hence, his association at the time of auction and sale has been thought appropriate by this Court. To put it differently, he has been conferred locus to put forth his stand in the said matters. Therefore, anyone who is aggrieved by any act done by the Recovery Officer can prefer an appeal. Such a statutory mode is provided under the RDB Act, which is a special enactment. DRT has the powers under the RDB Act to make an enquiry as it deems fit and confirm, modify or set aside the order made by the Recovery Officer in exercise of powers Under Sections 25 to 28 (both inclusive) of the RDB Act. Thus, the auction, sale and challenge are completely codified under the RDB Act, regard being had to the special nature of the legislation.

16. In addition to the aforesaid submissions, Mr. S. Ganesh, Senior Advocate also assisted us in the matter. He supported the above contentions, but sought a little intervention by requiring us to also examine the scope of the controversy under consideration, by placing reliance on the judgment of this Court in Sadashiv Prasad Singh v. Harendar Singh MANU/SC/0019/2014 : (2015) 5 SCC 574. Learned Counsel invited our attention to the scope of interference with reference to a public auction, wherein third party rights have emerged, especially when the third parties are independent of the disputants, and also, with reference to seeking recourse to a statutory remedy available to a party against the impugned order. The conclusions recorded by this Court in the Sadashiv Prasad Singh case MANU/SC/0019/2014 : (2015) 5 SCC 574, as were pointedly brought to our notice, are being extracted hereunder:
23. At the time of hearing, we were thinking of remanding the matter to the Recovery Officer to investigate into the objection of Harender Singh under Rule 11 of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1961. But considering the delay such a remand may cause, we have ourselves examined the objections of Harender Singh and rejected the objections for a variety of reasons:
23.1. Firstly, the contention raised at the hands of the Respondents before the High Court, that the facts narrated by Harender Singh [the Appellant in Special Leave Petition (C) No. 26550 of 2010] were a total sham, as he was actually the brother of one of the judgment-debtors, namely, Jagmohan Singh. And that Harender Singh had created an unbelievable story with the connivance and help of his brother, so as to save the property in question. The claim of Harender Singh in his objection petition was based on an unregistered agreement to sell dated 10-1-1991. Not only that such an agreement to sell would not vest any legal right in his favour, it is apparent that it may not have been difficult for him to have had the aforesaid agreement to sell notarised in connivance with his brother, for the purpose sought to be achieved.
23.2. Secondly, it is apparent from the factual position depicted in the foregoing paragraphs that Harender Singh, despite his having filed objections before the Recovery Officer, had abandoned the contest raised by him by not appearing (and by not being represented) before the Recovery Officer after 26-10-2005, whereas, the Recovery Officer had passed the order of sale of the property by way of public auction more than two years thereafter, only on 5-5-2008. Having abandoned his claim before the Recovery Officer, it was not open to him to have reagitated the same by filing a writ petition before the High Court.
23.3. Thirdly, a remedy of appeal was available to Harender Singh in respect of the order of the Recovery Officer assailed by him before the High Court Under Section 30, which is being extracted herein to assail the order dated 5-5-2008:
30. Appeal against the order of Recovery Officer.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 29, any person aggrieved by an order of the Recovery Officer made under this Act may, within thirty days from the date on which a copy of the order is issued to him, prefer an appeal to the Tribunal.
(2) On receipt of an appeal under Sub-section (1), the Tribunal may, after giving an opportunity to the Appellant to be heard, and after making such inquiry as it deems fit, confirm, modify or set aside the order made by the Recovery Officer in exercise of his powers Under Sections 25 to 28 (both inclusive).
The High Court ought not to have interfered with in the matter agitated by Harender Singh in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. In fact, the learned Single Judge rightfully dismissed the writ petition filed by Harender Singh.
23.4. Fourthly, Harender Singh could not be allowed to raise a challenge to the public auction held on 28-8-2008 because he had not raised any objection to the attachment of the property in question or the proclamations and notices issued in newspapers in connection with the auction thereof.
23.5. All these facts cumulatively lead to the conclusion that after 26-10-2005, Harender Singh had lost all interest in the property in question and had therefore, remained a silent spectator to various orders which came to be passed from time to time. He had, therefore, no equitable right in his favour to assail the auction-purchase made by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on 28-8-2008.
23.6. Finally, the public auction under reference was held on 28-8-2008. Thereafter the same was confirmed on 22-9-2008. Possession of the property was handed over to the auction-purchaser Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on 11-3-2009. The auction-purchaser initiated mutation proceedings in respect of the property in question. Harender Singh did not raise any objections in the said mutation proceedings. The said mutation proceedings were also finalised in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha. Harender Singh approached the High Court through CWJC No. 16485 of 2009 only on 27-11-2009. We are of the view that the challenged raised by Harender Singh ought to have been rejected on the grounds of delay and laches, especially because third-party rights had emerged in the meantime. More so, because the auction-purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for consideration, having purchased the property in furtherance of a duly publicised public auction, interference by the High Court even on the ground of equity was clearly uncalled for.
24. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are of the view that the impugned order dated 17-5-2010 passed by the High Court allowing Letters Patent Appeal No. 844 of 2010 deserves to be set aside. The same is accordingly set aside. The right of the Appellant Sadashiv Prasad Sinha in Plot No. 2722, Exhibition Road, PS Gandhi Maidan, Patna, measuring 1289 sq ft is hereby confirmed. In the above view of the matter, while the appeal preferred by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha stands allowed, the one filed by Harender Singh is hereby dismissed.
