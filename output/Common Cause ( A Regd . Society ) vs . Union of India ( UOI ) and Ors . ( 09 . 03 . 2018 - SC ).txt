Constitution - Sanctity of Life - Determination of Legal Status - Article 21 of Constitution of India - Present petition filed seeking declaration that right to die with dignity be declared fundamental right within right to live with dignity under Article 21 of Constitution - Whether advance directive be legalized - Whether to withdraw treatment for incompetent terminally ill patient, rational or irrational



Facts:

The Petitioner was a registered society engaged in taking of the common problems of the people. The present petition was filed to bring to the notice of this Court the serious problem of violation of fundamental right to life, liberty, privacy and the right to die with dignity of the people of this country, guaranteed to them under Article 21 of the Constitution. It was submitted that the people who are suffering from chronic diseases and are at the end of their natural life span are deprived of their rights to refuse cruel and unwanted medical treatment, like feeding through hydration tubes, being kept on ventilator and other life supporting machines in order to artificially prolong their natural life span. It was further pleaded that it was a common law right of the people, of any civilized country, to refuse unwanted medical treatment and no person could force him/her to take any medical treatment which the person did not desire to continue with.

Held, while allowing petition:



Dipak Misra, C.J.I. and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.

(i) The present Court noted that a careful and precise perusal of the judgment in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab reflects the right of a dying man to die with dignity when life is ebbing out, and in the case of a terminally ill patient, where there is no hope of recovery, accelerating the process of death for reducing the period of suffering constitutes a right to live with dignity. Common law jurisdictions reveal that all adults with capacity to consent have the right of self-determination and autonomy. The said rights pave the way for the right to refuse medical treatment which had acclaimed universal recognition. A competent person who had come of age has the right to refuse specific treatment or all treatment or opt for an alternative treatment, even if such decision entails a risk of death. The 'Emergency Principle' or the 'Principle of Necessity' has to be given effect to only when it is not practicable to obtain the patient's consent for treatment and his/her life is in danger. But where a patient has already made a valid Advance Directive which is free from reasonable doubt and specifying that he/she does not wish to be treated, then such directive had to be given effect to. Right to life and liberty as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution is meaningless unless it encompasses within its sphere individual dignity. The present Court noted that with the passage of time, this Court has expanded the spectrum of Article 21 to include within it the right to live with dignity as component of right to life and liberty. [195 ]



A.K. Sikri, J. :Concurring View

(ii) We do not cut short the sufferings of our ailing dear ones by death because, as a rule, we have always means at our disposal to help them and they have the capacity to think and decide for themselves. But supposing that in the case of an ailing friend, any aid whatever and recovery is out of question and the patient is lying in an unconscious state in the throes of agony, then there would be no hinsa in putting an end to his suffering by death. Just as a surgeon did not commit hinsa but practices the purest ahinsa when he wields his knife, one may find it necessary, under certain imperative circumstances, to go a step further and sever life from the body in the interest of the sufferer. It may be objected that whereas the surgeon performs his operation to save the life of the patient, in the other case we did just the reverse. But on a deeper analysis it would be found that the ultimate object sought to be served in both the cases is the same, namely, to relieve the suffering soul within from pain. The present Court concluded that to cause pain or wish ill to or to take the life of any living being out of anger or a selfish intent, is hinsa. On the other hand, after a calm and clear judgment to kill or cause pain to a living being from a pure selfless intent may be the purest form of ahinsa. [247 ]

(iii) Advance directives are instruments through which persons express their wishes at a prior point in time, when they are capable of making an informed decision, regarding their medical treatment in the future, when they are not in a position to make an informed decision, by reason of being unconscious or in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) or in a coma. A medical power of attorney is an instrument through which persons nominate representatives to make decisions regarding their medical treatment at a point in time when the persons executing the instrument are unable to make informed decisions themselves. The one hand autonomy of an individual gives him right to choose his destiny and, therefore, he may decide before hand, in the form of advance directive, at what stage of his physical condition he would not like to have medical treatment, and on the other hand, there are dangers of misuse thereof as well. The possibility of misuse could not be held to be a valid ground for rejecting advance directive, as opined by the Law Commission of India as well in its 196th and 241st Report. Instead, attempt could be made to provide safeguards for exercise of such advance directive. [327],[328] and[329]

(iv) The reason which had impelled the Court to recognize passive euthanasia and advance directives is that both bear a close association to the human urge to live with dignity. Age brings isolation. Physical and mental debility bring a loss of self worth. Pain and suffering are accompanied by a sense of being helpless. The loss of control is compounded when medical intervention takes over life. Human values are then lost to technology. More significant than the affliction of ageing and disease is the fear of our human persona being lost in the anonymity of an intensive care ward. It is hence necessary for this Court to recognize that our dignity as citizens continues to be safeguarded by the Constitution even when life is seemingly lost and questions about our own mortality confront us in the twilight of existence. The sanctity of human life is the arterial vein which animates the values, spirit and cellular structure of the Constitution. The Constitution recognizes the value of life as its indestructible component. The survival of the sanctity principle is founded upon the guarantees of dignity, autonomy and liberty. Constitutional recognition of the dignity of existence as an inseparable element of the right to life necessarily means that dignity attaches throughout the life of the individual. Dignity of life must encompass dignity in the stages of living which lead up to the end of life. Dignity in the process of dying is as much a part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. To deprive an individual of dignity towards the end of life is to deprive the individual of a meaningful existence. Hence, the Constitution protects the legitimate expectation of every person to lead a life of dignity until death occurs. The constitutionally recognized right to life is subject to the procedure established by law. The procedure for Regulation or deprivation must, it is well-settled, be fair, just and reasonable.

(v) The rights of bodily integrity and self-determination are the rights which belong to every human being. When an adult person having mental capacity to take a decision can exercise his right not to take treatment or withdraw from treatment, the above right could not be negated for a person who is not able to take an informed decision due to terminal illness or being a PVS. In case of a person who is suffering from a disease and is taking medical treatment, there are three stake holders; the person himself, his family members and doctor treating the patient. No person could take decision regarding life of another unless he is entitled to take such decision authorized under any law. The English Courts had applied the "best interests" test in case of a incompetent person. The best interests of the patient had to be found out not by doctor treating the patient alone but a team of doctors specifically nominated by the State Authority. The present Court was of the opinion that in cases of incompetent patients who are unable to take an informed decision, it was in the best interests of the patient that the decision be taken by competent medical experts. The medical team while taking decision shall also take into consideration the opinion of the blood relations of the patient and other relevant facts and circumstances. [563] and[564]

(vi) The concept of advance medical directive is also called living will is of recent origin, which gained recognition in latter part of 20th century. Many people living depending on machines cause great financial distress to the family with the cost of long term medical treatment. Advance medical directive was developed as a means to restrict the kinds of medical intervention in event when one become incapacitated. The foundation for seeking direction regarding advance medical directive is extension of the right to refuse medical treatment and the right to die with dignity. When a competent patient has right to take a decision regarding medical treatment, with regard to medical procedure entailing right to die with dignity, the said right cannot be denied to those patients, who have become incompetent to take an informed decision at the relevant time.

Conclusions in seriatim
A. Prologue:
1. Life and death as concepts have invited many a thinker, philosopher, writer and physician to define or describe them. Sometimes attempts have been made or efforts have been undertaken to gloriously paint the pictures of both in many a colour and shade. Swami Vivekananda expects one to understand that life is the lamp that is constantly burning out and further suggests that if one wants to have life, one has to die every moment for it. John Dryden, an illustrious English author, considers life a cheat and says that men favour the deceit. No one considers that the goal of life is the grave. Léon Montenaeken would like to describe life as short, a little hoping, a little dreaming and then good night. The famous poet Dylan Thomas would state "do not go gentle into that good night." One may like to compare life with constant restless moment spent in fear of extinction of a valued vapour; and another may sincerely believe that it is beyond any conceivable metaphor. A metaphysical poet like John Donne, in his inimitable manner, says:
One short sleep past, we wake eternally, And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.
Some would say with profound wisdom that life is to be lived only for pleasure and Ors. with equal wise pragmatism would proclaim that life is meant for the realization of divinity within one because that is where one feels the "self", the individuality and one's own real identity. Dharmaraj Yudhisthira may express that though man sees that death takes place every moment, yet he feels that the silence of death would not disturb him and nothing could be more surprising than the said thought. Yet others feel that one should never be concerned about the uncertain death and live life embracing hedonism till death comes. Charvaka, an ancient philosopher, frowns at the conception of re-birth and commends for living life to the fullest. Thus, death is complicated and life is a phenomenon which possibly intends to keep away from negatives that try to attack the virtue and vigour of life from any arena. In spite of all the statements, references and utterances, be it mystical, philosophical or psychological, the fact remains, at least on the basis of conceptual majority, that people love to live - whether at eighty or eighteen - and do not, in actuality, intend to treat life like an "autumn leaf". As Alfred Tennyson says:
No life that breathes with human breath has ever truly longed for death.
2. The perception is not always the same at every stage. There comes a phase in life when the spring of life is frozen, the rain of circulation becomes dry, the movement of body becomes motionless, the rainbow of life becomes colourless and the word life' which one calls a dance in space and time becomes still and blurred and the inevitable death comes near to hold it as an octopus gripping firmly with its tentacles so that the person "shall rise up never". The ancient Greet philosopher, Epicurus, has said, although in a different context:
Why should I fear death? If I am, then death is not. If death is, then I am not. Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not?
But there is a fallacy in the said proposition. It is because mere existence does not amount to presence. And sometimes there is a feebleness of feeling of presence in semi-reality state when the idea of conceptual identity is lost, quality of life is sunk and the sanctity of life is destroyed and such destruction is denial of real living. Ernest Hemingway, in his book The Old Man and the Sea', expounds the idea that man can be destroyed, but cannot be defeated. In a certain context, it can be said, life sans dignity is an unacceptable defeat and life that meets death with dignity is a value to be aspired for and a moment for celebration.
3. The question that emerges is whether a person should be allowed to remain in such a stage of incurable passivity suffering from pain and anguish in the name of Hippocratic oath or, for that matter, regarding the suffering as only a state of mind and a relative perception or treating the utterance of death as a "word infinitely terrible" to be a rhetoric without any meaning. In contradistinction to the same, the question that arises is should he not be allowed to cross the doors of life and enter, painlessly and with dignity, into the dark tunnel of death whereafter it is said that there is resplendence. In delineation of such an issue, there emerges the question in law-should he or she be given such treatment which has come into existence with the passage of time and progress of medical technology so that he/she exists possibly not realizing what happens around him/her or should his/her individual dignity be sustained with concern by smoothening the process of dying.
4. The legal question does not singularly remain in the set framework of law or, for that matter, morality or dilemma of the doctors but also encapsulates social values and the family mindset to make a resolute decision which ultimately is a cause of concern for all. There is also another perspective to it. A family may not desire to go ahead with the process of treatment but is compelled to do so under social pressure especially in a different milieu, and in the case of an individual, there remains a fear of being branded that he/she, in spite of being able to provide the necessary treatment to the patient, has chosen not to do so. The social psyche constantly makes him/her feel guilty. The collective puts him at the crossroads between socially carved out 'meaningful guilt' and his constant sense of rationality and individual responsibility. There has to be a legalistic approach which is essential to clear the maze and instill awareness that gradually melts the idea of "meaningful guilt" and ushers in an act of "affirmative human purpose" that puts humanness on a high pedestal.
5. There is yet another aspect. In an action of this nature, there can be abuse by the beneficiaries who desire that the patient's heart should stop so that his property is inherited in promptitude and in such a situation, the treating physicians are also scared of collusion that may invite the wrath of criminal law as well as social stigma. The medical, social and ethical apprehensions further cloud their mind to take a decision. The apprehension, the cultural stigma, the social reprehension, the allegation of conspiracy, the ethical dilemma and eventually the shadow between the individual desire and the collective expression distances the reality and it is here that the law has to have an entry to alleviate the agony of the individual and dispel the collective attributes and perceptions so that the imbroglio is clear. Therefore, the heart of the matter is whether the law permits for accelerating the process of dying sans suffering when life is on the path of inevitable decay and if so, at what stage and to what extent. The said issue warrants delineation from various perspectives.
B. Contentions in the Writ Petition:
6. The instant Writ Petition preferred Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by the Petitioner, a registered society, seeks to declare "right to die with dignity" as a fundamental right within the fold of "right to live with dignity" guaranteed Under Article 21 of the Constitution; to issue directions to the Respondents to adopt suitable procedure in consultation with the State Governments, where necessary; to ensure that persons of deteriorated health or terminally ill patients should be able to execute a document titled "My Living Will and Attorney Authorisation" which can be presented to the hospital for appropriate action in the event of the executant being admitted to the hospital with serious illness which may threaten termination of the life of the executant; to appoint a committee of experts including doctors, social scientists and lawyers to study into the aspect of issuing guidelines as to the "Living Wills"; and to issue such further appropriate directions and guidelines as may be necessary.
7. It is asserted that every individual is entitled to take his/her decision about the continuance or discontinuance of life when the process of death has already commenced and he/she has reached an irreversible permanent progressive state where death is not far away. It is contended that each individual has an inherent right to die with dignity which is an inextricable facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. That apart, it is set forth that right to die sans pain and suffering is fundamental to one's bodily autonomy and such integrity does not remotely accept any effort that puts the individual on life support without any ray of hope and on the contrary, the whole regime of treatment continues in spite of all being aware that it is a Sisyphean endeavour, an effort to light a bulb without the filament or to expect a situation to be in an apple pie order when it is actually in a state of chaos.
8. It is put forth that the concept of sustenance of individual autonomy inheres in the right of privacy and also comes within the fundamental conception of liberty. To sustain the stand of privacy, reliance has been placed on the decisions in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0085/1962 : (1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295, Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr. MANU/SC/0119/1975 : (1975) 2 SCC 148 and People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India and Anr. MANU/SC/0149/1997 : (1997) 1 SCC 301. Inspiration has also been drawn from the decision of the United States in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health 111 L Ed 2d 224: 497 US 261 (1990) : 110 S. Ct. 2841 (1990). It is averred that due to the advancement of modern medical technology pertaining to medical science and respiration, a situation has been created where the dying process of the patient is unnecessarily prolonged causing distress and agony to the patient as well as to the near and dear ones and, consequently, the patient is in a persistent vegetative state thereby allowing free intrusion. It is also contended that the Petitioner-society is not claiming that the right to die is a part of the right to life but asserting the claim that the right to die with dignity is an inseparable and inextricable facet of the right to live with dignity. The execution of a living will or issuance of advance directive has become a necessity in today's time keeping in view the prolongation of treatment in spite of irreversible prognosis and owing to penal laws in the field that creates a dilemma in the minds of doctors to take aid of the modern techniques in a case or not. A comparison has been made between the fundamental rights of an individual and the State interest focusing on sanctity as well as quality of life. References have been made to the laws in various countries, namely, United Kingdom, United States of America, Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Canada, etc. The autonomy of the patient has been laid stress upon to highlight the right to die with dignity without pain and suffering which may otherwise be prolonged because of artificial continuance of life through methods that are really not of any assistance for cure or improvement of living conditions.
C. Stand in the counter affidavit and the applications for intervention:
9. A counter affidavit has been filed by the Union of India contending, inter alia, that serious thought has been given to regulate the provisions of euthanasia. A private member's Bill and the 241st report of the Law Commission of India have been referred to. It has been set forth that the Law Commission had submitted a report on The Medical Treatment of Terminally-ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners) Bill, 2006 but the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was not in favour of the enactment due to the following reasons:
a) Hippocratic oath is against intentional/voluntary killings of patient.
b) Progression of medical science to relieve pain, suffering, rehabilitation and treatment of so-called diseases will suffer a set back.
c) An individual may wish to die at certain point of time, his/her wish may not be persistent and only a fleeting desire out of transient depression.
d) Suffering is a state of mind and a perception, which varies from individual to individual and depends on various environmental and social factors.
e) Continuous advancement in medical science has made possible good pain management in patients of cancer and other terminal illness. Similarly, rehabilitation helps many spinal injury patients in leading near normal life and euthanasia may not be required.
f) Wish of euthanasia by a mentally ill patient/in depression may be treatable by good psychiatric care.
g) It will be difficult to quantify suffering, which may always be subject to changing social pressures and norms.
h) Can doctors claim to have knowledge and experience to say that the disease is incurable and patient is permanently invalid?
i) Defining of bed-ridden and requiring regular assistance is again not always medically possible.
j) There might be psychological pressure and trauma to the medical officers who would be required to conduct euthanasia.
10. The counter affidavit further states that after the judgment was delivered by this Court in Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0176/2011 : (2011) 4 SCC 454, the Ministry of Law and Justice opined that the directions given by this Court have to be followed in such cases and the said directions should be treated as law. The Law Commission in its 241st Report titled "Passive Euthanasia-A Relook" again proposed for making a legislation on "Passive Euthanasia" and also prepared a draft Bill titled The Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners) Bill. The said Bill was referred to the technical wing of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Directorate General of Health Services-Dte. GHS) for examination in June 2014. It is the case of the Union of India that two meetings were held under the chairmanship of Special Director General of Health Service which was attended by various experts. A further meeting was held under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, on 22.05.2015 to examine the Bill. Thereafter, various meetings have been held by experts and the expert committee had proposed formulation of legislation on passive euthanasia.
11. Counter affidavits have been filed by various States. We need not refer to the same in detail. Suffice it to mention that in certain affidavits, emphasis has been laid on Articles 37, 39 and 47 which require the States to take appropriate steps as envisaged in the said Articles for apposite governance. That apart, it has been pronouncedly stated that the right to life does not include the right to die and, in any case, the right to live with dignity guaranteed Under Article 21 of the Constitution means availability of food, shelter and health and does not include the right to die with dignity. It is asseverated that saving the life is the primary duty of the State and, therefore, there is necessity for health care. It is also contended that the introduction of the right to die with dignity as a facet of the right Under Article 21 will create a right that the said constitutional provision does not envisage and further it may have the potential effect to destroy the said basic right.
12. An application for intervention has been filed by the "Society for the Right to Die with Dignity" whose prayer for intervention has been allowed. The affidavit filed by the said society supports the concept of euthanasia because it is a relief from irrecoverable suffering of which pain is a factor. It has cited many an example from various texts to support passive euthanasia and suggested certain criteria to be followed. It has also supported the idea of introduction of living will and durable power of attorney documents and has filed a sample of living will or advance health directive or advance declaration provided by Luis Kutner. Emphasis has been laid on peaceful exit from life and the freedom of choice not to live and particularly so under distressing conditions and ill-health which lead to an irrecoverable state. The management of terminally ill patients has been put at the centre stage. It has been highlighted that determination of the seemly criteria will keep the element of misuse by the family members or the treating physician or, for that matter, any interested person at bay and also remove the confusion. We have heard Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned Counsel for the Petitioner. Mr. P.S. Narasimha, learned Additional Solicitor General for Union of India, Mr. Arvind P. Datar learned senior Counsel and Mr. Devansh A. Mohta, learned Counsel who have supported the cause put forth in the writ petition.
D. Background of the Writ Petition:
13. Before we engage ourselves with the right claimed, it is requisite to state that the present litigation has a history and while narrating the same, the assertions made in the Writ Petition and the contentions which have been raised during the course of hearing, to which we shall refer in due course, are to be kept in mind.
D. 1 P. Rathinam's case - The question of unconstitutionality of Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code:
14. Presently, it is necessary to travel backwards in time, though not very far. Two individuals, namely, P. Rathinam and Nagbhushan Patnaik, filed two Writ Petitions Under Article 32 of the Constitution which were decided by a two-Judge Bench in P. Rathinam v. Union of India and Anr. MANU/SC/0433/1994 : (1994) 3 SCC 394. The writ petitions assailed the constitutional validity of Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code (Indian Penal Code) contending that the same is violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The Court posed 16 questions. The relevant ones read thus:
(1) Has Article 21 any positive content or is it merely negative in its reach?
(2) Has a person residing in India a right to die?
x x x x
(12) Is suicide against public policy?
(13) Does commission of suicide damage the monopolistic power of the State to take life?
(14) Is apprehension of 'constitutional cannibalism' justified?
(15) Recommendation of the Law Commission of India and follow-up steps taken, if any.
(16) Global view. What is the legal position in other leading countries of the world regarding the matter at hand?
15. Answering question No. (1), the Court, after referring to various authorities Under Article 21, took note of the authority in State of Himachal Pradesh and Anr. v. Umed Ram Sharma and Ors. MANU/SC/0125/1986 : (1986) 2 SCC 68 : AIR 1986 SC 847 wherein it has been observed that the right to life embraces not only physical existence but also the quality of life as understood in its richness and fullness within the ambit of the Constitution. In the said case, the Court had held that for residents of hilly areas, access to road was access to life itself and so, necessity of road communication in a reasonable condition was treated as a constitutional imperative. P. Rathinam perceived the elevated positive content in the said ruling. Answering question No. (2), the Court referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Maruti Shripati Dubal v. State of Maharashtra MANU/MH/0022/1986 : 1987 Cri. LJ 473 : (1986) 88 Bom LR 589 that placed reliance on R.C. Cooper v. Union of India MANU/SC/0074/1970 : (1970) 2 SCC 298: AIR 1970 SC 1318 wherein it had been held that what is true of one fundamental right is also true of another fundamental right and on the said premise, the Bombay High Court had opined that it cannot be seriously disputed that fundamental rights have their positive as well as negative aspects. Citing an example, it had stated that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom not to speak and similarly, the freedom of association and movement includes freedom not to join any association or move anywhere and, accordingly, it stated that logically it must follow that the right to live would include the right not to live, i.e., right to die or to terminate one's life.
16. After so stating, this Court approved the view taken by the Bombay High Court in Maruti Shripati Dubal and meeting the criticism of that judgment from certain quarters, the two-Judge Bench opined that the criticism was only partially correct because the negative aspect may not be inferable on the analogy of the rights conferred by different clauses of Article 19 and one may refuse to live if his life, according to the person concerned, is not worth living. One may rightly think that having achieved all worldly pleasures or happiness, he has something to achieve beyond this life. This desire for communion with God may rightly lead even a healthy mind to think that he would forego his right to live and would rather choose not to live. In any case, a person cannot be forced to enjoy the right to life to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking. Eventually, it concluded that the right to live of which Article 21 speaks of can be said to bring in its trail the right not to live a forced life.
17. Answering all the questions, the Court declared Section 309 Indian Penal Code ultra vires and held that it deserved to be effaced from the statute book to humanize our penal laws.
D. 2 Gian Kaur's case - The question of unconstitutionality of Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code:
18. The dictum laid down by the two-Judge Bench in P. Rathinam did not remain a precedent for long. In Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0335/1996 : (1996) 2 SCC 648, the Constitution Bench considered the correctness of the decision rendered in P. Rathinam. In the said case, the Appellants were convicted by the trial Court Under Section 306 Indian Penal Code and the conviction was assailed on the ground that Section 306 Indian Penal Code is unconstitutional and to sustain the said argument, reliance was placed on the authority in P. Rathinam wherein Section 309 Indian Penal Code was held to be unconstitutional being violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. It was urged that once Section 309 Indian Penal Code had been held to be unconstitutional, any person abetting the commission of suicide by another is merely assisting in the enforcement of the fundamental right Under Article 21 and, therefore, Section 306 Indian Penal Code penalizing abetment of suicide is equally violative of Article 21. The two-Judge Bench before which these arguments were advanced in appeal referred the matter to a Constitution Bench for deciding the same. In the course of arguments, one of the amicus curiae, Mr. F.S. Nariman, learned senior Counsel, had submitted that the debate on euthanasia is not relevant for deciding the question of constitutional validity of Section 309 and Article 21 cannot be construed to include within it the so-called "right to die" since Article 21 guarantees protection of life and liberty and not its extinction. The Constitution Bench, after noting the submissions, stated:
17.... We, therefore, proceed now to consider the question of constitutional validity with reference to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Any further reference to the global debate on the desirability of retaining a penal provision to punish attempted suicide is unnecessary for the purpose of this decision. Undue emphasis on that aspect and particularly the reference to euthanasia cases tends to befog the real issue of the constitutionality of the provision and the crux of the matter which is determinative of the issue.
