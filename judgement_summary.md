Judgement 2: Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The Petition was filed against the water pollution caused due to excessive release of pollutants by the tanneries and other industries in the State of Tamil Nadu into the river Palar. 
2. Whether the tanneries should be permitted to keep on working at the expense of the health of individuals and the environment?

Judgement 3: M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Few important outcomes: The Supreme Court did an amazing job of interpreting the "Public Trust Doctrine" and enabling it to apply in India. It also contributed in the establishment of the 'Polluter Pay Principle' and the 'Principle of Deterrence.'
2. Was the construction carried out by Span Motels Pvt. Ltd. legal and justified? Is it possible that Mr. Kamal Nath was wrongfully charged by the court? Whether or not the "Public Trust Doctrine" applies in India?

Category: Environment

Context: It is a doctrine that guarantees the protection of natural resources. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right to life, which means the right to a clean and healthy environment is also a fundamental right of the people of the State, and if this right is encroached upon under any circumstances, then the citizens have the right to go to court to enforce their fundamental right.

Judgement 4: Hanuman Laxman Aroskar and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Whether the Indian government's approval of a new airport adequately considered environmental impacts
2. The government took notice of the addition environmental impact information provided, including a commitment to make the airport a "zero carbon airport operation," and imposed addition environmental conditions on the project.
3. The Court also appointed the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute to oversee compliance with the government's environmental conditions

Judgement 5: Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. (3) v. Bombay Environmental Action Group and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Whether the mill owners can undertake further constructions and/or create third-party rights without assuming any equity and subject to the orders of the Court. 
2. The Court ruled that the mill owners who engage in further constructions and/or creation of third-party rights do so at their own risk and cannot claim any equity. Any such constructions and/or third-party rights shall be subject to the orders of the Court. The applicants are permitted to proceed with the demolition works on the property and are allowed to raise boundary walls for the pro-tection of their land. 
3. However, any new applications for the approval of layouts, issuance of IODs, or commencement certifications may be processed, but no construction shall be carried out based on these approvals. 

Category: Property (?)

Context: Basically it is related to re/further development of land. I think this case being cited in the context of environment is related to land-use patterns. When talking about Article 14/21, The contention about whether people can undertake further constructions and create third-party rights raises issues of equality before the law. The right to life under Article 21 encompasses not only the right to physical existence but also the right to livelihood and a decent environment.

Citation Search Collation: 
1. The right to information and community participation for protection of environment and human health is also a right which flows from Article 21 vide Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Bombay Environmental Action Group and Ors. 
2. It is also a well-settled principle of law that in a case where a statute is found to be obscure the same must be interpreted having regard to the constitutional scheme. In a case of this nature, the doctrine of purposive construction should be applied. 
3. referring to a large number of decisions, it was stated that whereas need to protect the environment is a priority, it is also necessary to promote development stating:

...The harmonization of the two needs has led to the concept of sustainable development, so much so that it has become the most significant and focal point of environmental legislation and judicial decisions relating to the same. Sustainable development, simply put, is a process in which development can be sustained over generations. Brundtland Report defines 'sustainable development' as development that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. Making the concept of sustainable development operational for public policies raises important challenges that involve complex synergies and trade offs. 
4.  It provides for High Tension tariff. It fixes up cut-off dates. It is a piece of subordinate legislation. A subordinate legislation validly made may have to be read in the same manner as if it is a part of the Act. For the said purpose, although the same would be amenable to constitutional challenge on well-settled principles of law, as noticed by this Court. 
5. In Francis Bennion's Statutory Interpretation, purposive construction has been described in the following manner:

A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives effect to the legislative purpose by--

(a) following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose (in this Code called a purposive-and-literal construction), or-

(b) applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in accordance with the legislative purpose (in the Code called a purposive-and-strained construction). 
6. We do not mean to say that the policy decision of the State is beyond the realm of judicial review. However, power of judicial review can be exercised only on the basis of known legal principles. 
7. The High Court's jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari though is limited, a writ of certiorari can be issued if there is an error of law apparent on the face of the record. What would constitute an error of law is well known. In the Judicial Review of Administrative Action, IVth edition p.136, S.A De Smith has summed up the position:-

The concept of error of law includes the giving of reasons that are bad in law or (if there is a duty to give reasons) inconsistent, intelligible or, it would seem, substantially inadequate. It includes also the application of a wrong legal test to the facts found, taking irrelevant considerations into account and failing to take relevant considerations into account, exercising a discretion on the basis of any other incorrect legal principles, misdirection as to the burden of proof, and wrongful admission or exclusion of evidence, as well as arriving at a conclusion without any supporting evidence.

Judgement 6: Justice K.S. Puttaswamy and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors

Main Contention:
1. The case began with the question of whether the right to privacy was a fundamental right, which was raised in 2015 in the arguments concerning the legal validity of the Aadhaar database. 
2. The nine Judge Bench in this case unanimously reaffirmed the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India. The Court held that the right to privacy was integral to freedoms guaranteed across fundamental rights, and was an intrinsic aspect of dignity, autonomy and liberty.

Category: Privacy and fundamental rights

Context: The right to privacy can be relevant in environmental cases where individual privacy intersects with environmental protection. For example, issues related to surveillance, tribal lives, or the impact of certain environmental policies/acts on the private lives of people may come into play. While the primary focus of the case was on privacy, the recognition of fundamental rights, including privacy under Article 21, can also be linked to protection from arbitrary state action under Article 14. In the environmental context, if state actions or policies are perceived as arbitrary, discriminatory, or violating the principles of equality, individuals may seek protection under Article 14.

Citation Search Collation: 
1. Similarly, the majority and concurring opinion in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, while elaborating on the duty of the State and non-State actors to protect the rights of citizens, pointed out that recognition and enforcement of claims qua non-State actors may require legislative intervention. 
2. Recently, in K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors, this Court had once again emphasized on the right to human dignity which, first and foremost, means the dignity of each human being 'as a human being'. 
3. Thereafter, in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors., a nine-Judge Bench of this Court unanimously declared that there is a fundamental right of privacy which enured in favour of all persons, the concomitant of which was that the right to make choices that were fundamental to a person's way of living could not be interfered with by the State without compelling necessity and/or harm caused to other individuals.
4. In K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, this Court affirmed the individual as the bearer of the constitutional guarantee of rights. Such rights are devoid of their guarantee when despite legal recognition, the social, economic and political context enables an atmosphere of continued discrimination. 
5. 8...We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings...it must in any view of the matter, include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human-self. Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and just procedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights.

This was re-affirmed by the Constitution bench decision in K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. 
6. The proposition that sexual orientation is integral to one's personality and identity was affirmed by the Constitution Bench in K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. 
7. He then went on to argue that these provisions must be construed strictly in favour of the subject, inasmuch as they impinge upon the fundamental right to privacy, recently recognised by this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.In K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors., a nine-Judge Bench of this Court unanimously held that the right to privacy is a fundamental right.

Judgement 7: Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Whether the respondent is liable to pay the amount necessary to carry out the appropriate remedial action?
2. Whether the industries involved in the manufacturing of these toxic chemicals had taken any environmental precautions?
3. In India, Polluter Pay Principle was first implemented and defined in 1996 under this case law. According to this principle, the polluter has to not only compensate the victims of pollution caused by his activity but also has to pay for the restoration of environmental degradation

Category: Environment

Context: Both Article 14 and Article 21 require a balance between individual rights and the broader public interest. The Polluter Pay Principle strikes such a balance by imposing financial responsibility on polluters while addressing the collective interest in maintaining a healthy environment.

Judgement 8: Mantri Techzone Pvt. Ltd. v. Forward Foundation and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The construction is in violation of the Wetlands (Conservation of Management) Rules, 2010. Approximately 840 km of Rajakaluves have been encroached upon. The land should be classified and maintained as a sensitive area. 
2. The plans were approved despite objections. A buffer/green zone should be maintained around the lakes. Only one million litre per month of STP treated water is used for construction purposes. Storm drains should have a buffer zone of 15 in on either bank maintained as a green belt. 
3. All project proponents must use treated sewage water for construction purposes. The green belt created under the directions of the Tribunal is not part of the project's green belt.

Note: Tribunal here refers to National Green Tribunal (NGT)

Judgement 9: R.K. Garg and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Around the Special Bearer Bonds (Immunities and Exemptions) Act, 1981. The Act was tested inter alia on The ground that it made an unreasonable classification between people who wrongfully sidestepped payment of taxes as against the individuals who submitted to the law. 
2. It was contended that such an arrangement in the law was against ethics or morality as it afforded tax dodgers, immunities and exclusions, and put them at a profitable situation in contrast with the individuals who abided by the law.

Category: Taxation and Constitutional Law (?)

Context: It could mean that individuals and entities should be treated equally with regard to regulatory obligations and consequences for environmental violations. If specific groups receive preferential treatment or exemptions that impact the environment, it could raise concerns under Article 14. If certain legal provisions, such as immunities or exclusions, contribute to environmental degradation that affects the right to life, it could be contested under Article 21.

Citation Search Collation:
1. Reliance is also placed on R.K. Garg v. Union of India and Ors., wherein it has been observed that the Courts have only the power of destroying and not to reconstruct. 
2. We need to remind ourselves the dictum of this Court in R.K. Garg - that it is not for the Court to consider relative merits of the different political theories or economic policies including that an economic legislation may be troubled with crudities, inequities, uncertainties or the possibility of abuse cannot be the basis for striking it down. 
3. It is contended by Shri Ashim Sood, learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the impugned Circular does not have either the status of a legislation or the status of an executive action, but is only the exercise of a power conferred by statute upon a statutory body corporate. Therefore, it is his contention that the judicial Rule of deference as articulated in R.K. Garg v. Union of India 
4. Finally, in R.K. Garg v. Union of India, it was held by Justice Bhagwati, speaking for the Court as follows:

Now while considering the constitutional validity of a statute said to be violative of Article 14, it is necessary to bear in mind certain well established principles which have been evolved by the courts as rules of guidance in discharge of its constitutional function of judicial review. The first rule is that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles. This rule is based on the assumption, judicially recognised and accepted, that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discrimination are based on adequate grounds. The presumption of constitutionality is indeed so strong that in order to sustain it, the Court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation.
5. In this context, reliance was placed on: (i) the presumption of constitutional validity 
6. Noted with approval by this Court in R.K. Garg-"that the Courts have only the power to destroy, not to reconstruct. When these are added to the complexity of economic Regulation, the uncertainty, the liability to error, the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the Judges have been overruled by events-self limitation can be seen to be the path of judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability." 
7. In R.K. Garg v. Union of India, the Constitution Bench reiterated the well-settled principles in the following words:

While considering the constitutional validity of a statute said to be violative of Article 14, it is necessary to bear in mind certain well established principles which have been evolved by the courts as rules of guidance in discharge of its constitutional function of judicial review. The first rule is that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles. This rule is based on the assumption, judicially recognised and accepted, that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discrimination are based on adequate grounds. The presumption of constitutionality is indeed so strong that in order to sustain it, the Court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation. 
8. The Court then referred to an earlier decision in the case of R.K. Garg v. Union of India and Ors., where there was an unsuccessful challenge to a law enacted by Parliament and held at page 413 as follows:-

"What has been said in respect of legislations is applicable even in respect of policies which have been adopted by Parliament. They cannot be tested in Court of Law. The courts cannot express their opinion as to whether at a particular juncture or under a particular situation prevailing in the country any such national policy should have been adopted or not. There may be views and views, opinions and opinions which may be shared and believed by citizens of the country including the representatives of the people in Parliament. But that has to be sorted out in Parliament which has to approve such policies. Privatization is a fundamental concept underlying the questions about the power to make economic decisions. What should be the role of the State in the economic development of the nation? How the resources of the country shall be used? How the goals fixed shall be attained? What are to be the safeguards to prevent the abuse of the economic power? What is the mechanism of accountability to ensure that the decision regarding privatisation is in public interest? All these questions have to be answered by a vigilant Parliament. Courts have their limitations - because these issues rest with the policy-makers for the nation. No direction can be given or is expected from the courts unless while implementing such policies, there is violation or infringement of any of the constitutional or statutory provision. The new Telecom policy was placed before Parliament and it shall be deemed that Parliament has approved the same. This Court cannot review and examine as to whether the said policy should have been adopted. Of course, whether there is any legal or constitutional bar in adopting such policy can certainly be examined by the Court". 
9. In R.K. Garg v. Union of India and Ors., this Court noticed that the legislature is presumed to understand and correctly appreciate the needs of its own people, but the same again would not mean that judicial review of legislation is impermissible.

Judgement 10: Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India and Ors.

Main Contention:
1.  The judgment revolves around the question of whether the International Airport Authority is “State” under
Article 12 of the Constitution and the validity of a tender accepted by the respondents.
2. Whether the tender confirmed by the respondents is constitutionally valid? 

Category: Constitutional Law

Context: The decision-making processes related to the tender and project approval should not discriminate against any particular group or community concerning environmental consequences. Article 14 could be invoked to argue against discriminatory practices in environmental decision-making. Article 21 requires a balance between development activities and the preservation of a healthy environment. The case's alignment with Article 21 could involve assessing whether the development project and the tender's approval maintain this balance, protecting individuals' right to life and personal liberty by ensuring a sustainable environment.

1. The Scheme underlying the Constitution of India entrust and oblige the Governments to carry out different functions for achieving the constitutional objectives to secure justice, liberty equality and fraternity. This Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India and Ors. has noted necessity to forge a new instrumentality or administrative device to keep up with governmental functions. 
2. Whenever a new advance is made in the field of human rights, apprehension is always expressed by the status quoists that it will create enormous difficulties in the way of smooth functioning of the system and affect its stability. Similar apprehension was voiced when this Court in R.D. Shetty case. 
3. It is said that the method now chosen for the development involves a policy impermissible for a Government body. This contention of the appellants, as a legal contention is somewhat vague and does not admit of clear-cut legal contours. As we apprehend the contention, it pertains to the legality or propriety of a policy-option. However, reliance was placed on certain observations of this Court in Ramana Dayanand Shetty v. International Airport Authority 
4. the following six tests were culled out from its earlier judgment in the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India and Ors.:
    (1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is held by Government it would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government. (SCC p. 507, para 14)
    (2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character. (SCC p.508, para 15)
    (3) It may also be a relevant factor...whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State conferred or State protected. (SCC p. 508, para 15)
    (4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the corporation is a State agency or instrumentality. (SCC p. 508, para 15)
    (5) If the functions of the corporation of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of Government. (SCC p. 509, para 16)
    (6) "Specifically, if a department of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference' of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government. (SCC p. 510, para 18).

Judgement 11: Vishaka and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. If formal guidelines were required to deal with incidents involving sexual harassment at the workplace? 
2. Whether sexual harassment at the workplace amounts to the violation of the fundamental rights of a woman? 
3. If the employer has any responsibility in cases of sexual harassment by its employee or to its employees at a workplace?

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: Article 14 ensures equality before the law and equal protection of laws. In the context of ecology and the environment, this principle could be applied to ensure that environmental protections are equally applied to all individuals and communities, preventing discriminatory practices in environmental policies. (?)

Citation Search Collation:
1. Wherein this Court had highlighted the need for enactment of a suitable legislation to deal with mob violence/lynching in the country. Reliance was placed on judgments of this Court in Vishaka and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors.
2. Resort to Article 32 read with Article 142 of the Constitution in such situations was in continuation of similar views expressed in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, wherein this Court held in paragraph 16 of the Report that in the absence of enacted law,

...... to provide for the effective enforcement of the basic human right of gender equality and guarantee against sexual harassment and abuse, more particularly against sexual harassment at workplaces, we lay down the guidelines and norms specified hereinafter for due observance at all workplaces or other institutions, until a legislation is enacted for the purpose. This is done in exercise of the power available Under Article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of the fundamental rights and it is further emphasised that this would be treated as the law declared by this Court Under Article 141 of the Constitution.
3. Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Vishaka and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. para 13, Shri Parikh has submitted that in framing the guidelines to ensure prevention of sexual harassment at work place this Court has placed reliance on the fact that the Government of India has ratified some of the resolutions adopted in the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and had made known its commitments to the cause of women's human rights in the Fourth World Conference of Women held in Beijing. 
4. The endeavour of this Court to ensure a virtual judicial incorporation of treaty law into the corpus juris is demonstrated by its opinion in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, in the following words:

"The meaning and content of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution of India are of sufficient amplitude to encompass all the facets of gender equality including prevention of sexual harassment or abuse. Independence of judiciary forms a part of our constitutional scheme. The international conventions and norms are to be read into them in the absence of enacted domestic law occupying the field when there is no inconsistency between them. It is now an accepted rule of judicial construction that regard must be had to international conventions and norms for construing domestic law when there is no inconsistency between them and there is a void in the domestic law."

Judgement 13: Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India

Main Contention:
1. Whether the writ petition filed under Article 32 of the constitution is valid or not.
2. Whether any fundamental right of the worker was actually violated or not.
3. Whether the Supreme court is empowered to appoint any commission or investigating body under Article 32 of the constitution or not.
4. Whether the workmen mentioned tin the case are bonded labourers are not
5. Whether workmen in the present case entitled to relief under various social labour legislations or not.

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: The case might involve an examination of the working conditions and labor practices, which could indirectly relate to environmental concerns. Certain industries or practices may have environmental consequences, such as pollution or resource depletion. A case addressing labor conditions may indirectly contribute to discussions about the environmental impact of certain industries. A workplace with poor environmental conditions may also pose risks to the health of workers, and improvements in labor conditions might lead to corresponding improvements in environmental health.

Citation Search Collation:
1. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and Ors. wherein this Court underlined the importance of satisfactory verification of allegations. The Court was asked to be ever vigilant against abuse of its process and there was need for appropriate verification.
2. Our Supreme Court was one of the first Courts to develop the concept of right to 'healthy environment' as part of the right to "life" under Article 21 of our Constitution. See Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India. This principle has now been adopted in various countries today.
3. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, this Court considered whether a letter addressed to a Judge of this Court could be treated as a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution and whether directions could be issued for release of an indeterminate number of citizens who were held as bonded labourers.
4. The right to work would become as much a fundamental right. Fundamental rights can ill-afford to be consigned to the limbo of undefined premises and uncertain application. That will be a mockery of them. In Bandhu Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, this Court had held that right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and that opportunities and facilities should be provided to the children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity.
5. A person invoking the jurisdiction of this Court Under Article 32 must approach this Court for the vindication of the fundamental rights of affected persons and not for the purpose of vindication of his personal grudge or enmity. It is duty of this Court to discourage such petitions and to ensure that the course of justice is not obstructed or polluted by unscrupulous litigants by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court for personal matters under the garb of the public interest litigation, see Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India
6. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and Ors., this Court had the occasion to consider the nature of a proceeding under Article 32 of the Constitution which is in the following terms:
    32. Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.
    (1) The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.
    (2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.
    (3) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on the Supreme Court by Clause (1) and (2), Parliament may by law empower any other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under Clause (2).
    (4) The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitution.
7. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in the case of Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, it is submitted that the High Court has rightly entertained the Public Interest Litigation petitions and has rightly quashed the entire acquisition proceedings. It is submitted that the High Court has rightly entertained and allowed the Public Interest Litigation petitions as by the acquisition of such a huge tract of land to the extent of 6000 acres, affecting 30,000 people, who were too weak, poor and disadvantaged, who could not approach the court for legal redress.

Judgement 14: Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Anr.

Main Contention:
1. The landmark ruling in Maneka Gandhi versus Union of India, which stands as a bulwark of the Right of Personal Liberty granted by Article 21 of the Constitution, started when the passport of the petitioner in this case, was impounded by the authorities under the provisions of the Passport Act.
2. Are the provisions under Articles 21, 14 and 19 connected with each other or are they mutually exclusive? Should the procedure established by law be tested for reasonability which in this case was the procedure laid down by the Passport Act of 1967?
3. If the right to travel outside the country is a part of Article 21 or not? Is a legislative law that snatches away the right to life reasonable?

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: If the case involves challenging procedures established by environmental laws, it may indirectly touch upon the reasonableness of such procedures under Article 21. This could influence how environmental laws are scrutinized for their impact on personal liberties and overall reasonableness. If there are allegations of arbitrary or discriminatory actions by the state or any authority in the context of constructions, approvals, or demolitions, Article 14 could be invoked to challenge such actions.

Citation Search Collation:
1. As has been stated by this Court in Maneka Gandhi's case that it would include all that gives meaning to a man's life, for example, his tradition, culture, heritage and protection of that heritage in its full measure. In still recent cases this Court has given liberal interpretation to the word 'life' in Article 21.
2. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Anr., the Court has taken the view that when the constitutionality of a law is challenged on the ground that it infringes a fundamental right, what the Court has to consider is the 'direct and inevitable effect' of such law. A matter within the legislative competence of the legislature has to be left to the discretion and wisdom of the framers, so long as it does not infringe any constitutional provision or violate any fundamental right. 
3. Moreover, the need for well-recognised principles to govern the 'deadly' discretion is so interlaced with fair procedure that unregulated power may even militate against Article 21 as expounded in Maneka Gandhi's case Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India an aspect into which we do not enter here. Judicial absolutism or ad-hocism is anathema in our constitutional scheme.
4. In Maneka Gandhi, this Court wrote : Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India:
    We must reiterate here what was pointed out by the majority in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu namely that "from a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch.
5. After long judicial debate, it now stands settled that the procedure established by law has to be 'due procedure' (See Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India). By judicial interpretation, this Court has read the principle of reasonableness into the said procedure contemplated by Article 21, holding that it must be 'right and just and fair' and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. 
6. However, the amended provision is excessive, irrational, arbitrary and falls foul of test of proportionality. It suffers from the vice of disproportionate restrictions and failure to provide fair procedure. To buttress the grounds of challenge, reliance is placed on Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Anr. 
7. It was submitted that in view of the decision of this Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, the Act can be struck down not only on the ground of being discriminatory in nature but also on the ground of being arbitrary.

Judgement 15: Common Cause and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Whether the right to die with dignity was a fundamental right within the fold of the right to live with dignity guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.
2. It further sought directions to the State to adopt appropriate procedures to allow persons who were of deteriorated health or who were terminally ill to execute Advance Medical Directives or living wills. 

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: Article 21 encompasses the right to life, and decisions related to the right to die with dignity may indirectly touch upon the quality of life. In an environmental context, factors such as air and water quality, access to green spaces, and exposure to environmental pollutants can significantly impact an individual's quality of life and overall health. Alignments with Article 14 may involve considerations of vulnerable populations and their exposure to environmental risks. Vulnerable groups, such as those with deteriorated health or terminal illnesses, may be disproportionately affected by certain environmental hazards, and equal protection under the law may be crucial in addressing these disparities.

Where it has been held by the Division Bench that no right can be given to use Nadi land or other water bodies for construction activity and that catchment of pond/water reservoir shall not be allotted for any personal/commercial purposes; that utilizing the 'Johad' land for commercial purpose may cause environmental damage; that the High Court has erred in placing reliance on Director General, Research and Development; that there are decisions of this Court as in Common Cause v. Union of India
2. In the case of Common Cause, this Court was seized of the aspect of illegal/unlawful mining in the State of Odisha and it was observed that Courts cannot interfere with the Mining Policy or lay down limits on the extent of mining activity that should be permitted by the State/Central Government.
3. The learned Senior Counsel further submits that FSI, while conducting the survey, has not taken into consideration the rotation period and, therefore, the survey is erroneous on the said count also. Learned Senior Counsel, in support of his submissions, relies on the judgment of this Court in the cases of Common Cause v. Union of India and Ors.
4. Any ex post facto approval is void and the benefit of the circular cannot be given to such an industry. In this regard, reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Common Cause v. Union of India
5. The absence of the expression "prior" in the EIA notification dated 27 January 1994 makes no difference since the words "shall not be undertaken...unless" postulate the requirement of a prior EC. Speaking for a two judge Bench of this Court in Common Cause v. Union of India ("Common Cause"), Justice Madan B Lokur rejected the submission which was urged on behalf of mining leaseholders that:
    108... the possibility of getting an ex post facto EC was a signal to the mining leaseholders that obtaining an EC was not mandatory or that it if was not obtained, the default was retrospectively condonable.
6.  It is asserted in the I.A. that fixing a cap upon extraction of minerals ought to be left to the discretion of the Executive branch and, in fact, in an Order dated 2.08.2017 in Common Cause v. U.O.I. and Ors., this Court has mentioned that fixing a cap upon extraction of mineral ore is really the business of the Executive branch of the Central Government and not of this Court.
7. This is not the first time that we have noticed such clarificatory communications being issued by the officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, which virtually have the effect of nullifying the statutory provisions and notifications. We have adverted to some of these communications in our judgment in Common Cause v. Union of India
8. Ms. Anitha Shenoy, learned Senior Counsel for the applicant relies upon judgments of this Court reported as Common Cause v. Union of India and Ors. to contend that prior Environmental Clearance is mandatory. Since the unit has been set up in violation of the notification, the Tribunal could not permit the unit to operate.

Judgement 16: M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. In this case, the SC ipheld the constitutional validity of the 77th and 85th constitutional amendments that provided for reservations in promotions for SC/ST communities in public employment.
2. However, the court also imposed certain conditions that the government must fulfil brfore granting such reservations. The three conditions set by the court were:
    i. The state must demonstrate the backwardness of the SC/ST communities.
    ii. The state must demonstrate the inadequacy of their representation in public employment.
    iii. The state must demonstrate that the reservation in promotions is not effecting thre overall efficiency of public administration.

Category: Reservation and Fundamental Rights

Context: The principles established in the case regarding reservations and social inclusivity may indirectly contribute to environmental justice considerations. Ensuring that historically marginalized communities, including SC/ST communities, have fair representation and opportunities in various sectors, including public employment, is part of a broader effort towards social inclusivity. This would include the representation of tribes in environmental policy, initiatives and conservation projects.

In this batch of Writ Petitions preferred Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India the prayer relates to issue of a direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the Respondents to enforce appropriately the constitutional mandate as contained under the provisions of Articles 16(4-A), 16(4-B) and 335 of the Constitution of India or, in the alternative, directing the Respondents to constitute a Committee or appoint a Commission chaired either by a retired Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court in making: survey and collecting necessary qualitative data of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the services of the State for granting reservation in promotion in the light of direction gives by this Court in M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.
2. It is put forth by him that Under Article 136 power of judicial review is conferred on this Court by the Constitution of legislative action, judicial decision and administrative action and the said power of judicial review is the basic feature of the Constitution which cannot be curtailed by a statutory provision as enshrined Under Sections 6(2) and 11 of the 1956 Act. For the aforesaid purpose, learned senior Counsel has commended us to the authorities in M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.
3. Likewise, a Constitution Bench of this Court in M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. felt it necessary to make following remarks:
    Equality of opportunity has two different and distinct concepts. There is a conceptual distinction between a non-discrimination principle and affirmative action under which the State is obliged to provide a level-playing field to the oppressed classes. Affirmative action in the above sense seeks to move beyond the concept of non-discrimination towards equalising results with respect to various groups. Both the conceptions constitute "equality of opportunity".
4. Recently, a Constitution Bench of this Court in M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. has reaffirmed the importance of the creamy layer principle in the scheme of equality under the constitution. This Court held that the creamy layer principle was on of the important limits on state power under the Equality Clause enshrined under Articles 14 and 16 and any violation or dilution of the same would render the state action invalid. 
5. The Court observed that the protection of fundamental rights has been considerably widened. In that context, reference had been made to M. Nagaraj and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. wherein it has been held that a fundamental right becomes fundamental because it has foundational value.

Judgement 18: Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The environment clearance given by the prime minister after there was a difference of opinion between the ministry of water resources and the ministry of environment and forest. 
2. The construction of the dam was challenged by the way of writ petitions where the appellant made several contentions for delaying the construction. 
3. Narmada Bachao Andolan cited displacement and rehabilitation problem that the project would cause. It called for further study as well as postponement of construction pending completion of such study. It has also argued for reduction in the height of the dam so as to reduce the extent of submergence and the consequent displacement.
4. Finally, the court using the doctrine of separation of powers and opinion the importance of policy decisions allowed the construction of a dam till 90 meters as clearance given by the environment subgroup with other directions.

Judgement 19: Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The utilization of an empty plot of land which was reserved for the construction of a public park but it was the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) who allotted that open space for a hospital’s construction. Such allotment was challenged by the local residents who claimed that such land allotment goes against the constitutional provisions for environmental protection.
2. Considering the facts, the Apex Court held that any act which hinders the basic values of individual freedom, human dignity, and quality of life which has been guaranteed to all the citizens under Article 14 will directly be in conflict with the fundamental Right to Equality and equal protection of the law.

Category: Land Use (?) and Fundamental Rights

Context: The local residents challenging the land allotment on constitutional grounds for environmental protection indicates the recognition of the constitutional role in safeguarding the environment. The case is possibly invoking principles derived from Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) and other constitutional guarantees. The court's holding that any act hindering basic values of individual freedom, human dignity, and quality of life is in conflict with the fundamental Right to Equality under Article 14, if the utilization of the land negatively impacts the quality of life or dignity of the residents, it may be seen as violating their right to equality.

1. It is urged that the Respondents have acted in an arbitrary manner and have violated Article 21 as well as the Doctrine of Public Trust by denying basic access to public/recreational spaces which are essential to life and liberty. To buttress their submissions, the Petitioners have placed reliance upon Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and Ors.
2. learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners further submitted that the Respondents did not place complete information regarding the proposed changes in public domain and without adequate information, it entailed in denial of opportunity of raising effective objections. Reliance has been placed upon a series of judgments to support the view that a Master Plan ought to be preceded by a comprehensive consultative exercise based on multiple parameters including population density, availability of open spaces etc.
3.  This Court has considered the power of the government to grant lease or issue directions to the Corporation to lease out open land reserved for public use to private trust to establish hospital and explained the context in which the power could be exercised when the land was reserved for town scheme or city scheme in Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa
4. Law is well-settled in this regard. In Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and Ors., this Court had considered the question whether area reserved for a public park can be converted for other purposes. The State Government by the subsequent order had allotted the area reserved for public parks to a Medical Trust, for the purposes of constructing a hospital. This Court has laid down the importance of open spaces and public parks in the said case and held that said spaces are a "gift from people to themselves". 
5. This was challenged by a public interest litigation contending that once the land is earmarked for a particular purpose, namely to promote environmental exigencies, the same cannot be de-reserved to defeat the public purpose. Heavy reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and Ors.

Judgement 20: Virender Gaur and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The case involved construction on land designated for public use, particularly reserved for open spaces for better sanitation, ventilation, and recreational purposes. However, it was subsequently leased out by the government to a private party for ninety-nine years and construction of buildings commenced.
2. The court found that the action of leasing the land is in violation of the law and the constitution. The court cited the Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The court said that the Declaration affirms both natural and human-made aspects of the environment and protection is essential to his well being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights, i.e., the right to life itself. 
3. The right to have an atmosphere congenial to human existence is the right to life. Enjoyment of life and its attainment including their right to life with human dignity encompasses within its ambit, the protection and preservation of environment, ecological balance free from pollution of air and water, sanitation without which life cannot be enjoyed.

Category: Land Use and Fundamental Rights

Context: The case revolves around the improper use of land designated for public purposes, specifically reserved for open spaces, sanitation, ventilation, and recreational purposes. This implicates concerns related to urban planning, sustainable development, and the importance of preserving open spaces for environmental well-being. 

Citation Search Collation:
1. In Virender Gaur and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors., referring to principle No. 1 of Stockholm Declaration of United Nations on Human Environment, 1972, this Court observed that right to have living atmosphere congenial to human existence is a right to life. The State has a duty in that behalf and to shed its extravagant unbridled sovereign power and to forge in its policy to maintain ecological balance and hygienic environment. Where in the Zonal plan, a land is marked out and reserved for park or recreational purpose, it cannot be allotted for building purpose though housing is a public purpose.
2. The International Association for the Protection of Nature and Natural Resources calculates that now, on average, one species or sub-species is lost every year. It is said that approximately 1000 birds and animal species are facing extinction at present. It is for this that the environmental questions have become urgent and they have to be properly understood and squarely met by man. Nature and history are two components of the environment in which we live, move and prove ourselves. This Court in Virender Gaur v. State of Haryana has highlighted these aspects.
3. In Virender Gaur and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors., it was stated:
    It is seen that the open lands, vested in the Municipality, were meant for the public amenity to the residents of the locality to maintain ecology, sanitation, recreation, playground and ventilation purposes. The buildings directed to be constructed necessarily affect the health and the environment adversely, sanitation and other effects on the residents in the locality. Therefore, the order passed by the Government and the action taken pursuant thereto by the Municipality would clearly defeat the purpose of the scheme....
4.  The High Court in its impugned order followed a decision of the High Court of Gujarat in Pravinbhai Jashbhai Patel and Anr. Vs. State of Gujarat and Ors., wherein it was noticed that the industrial units though aware of the requirements of law had not complied with the same nor did they meet the GPCB parameters and they were irresponsible in not wanting or caring to set up effluent treatment plants but continued to manufacture and pollute the environment and the concern shown now in meeting with the pollution control norms is only because of the threatened court order; that pollution caused by these industrial units was adversely affecting large number of citizens residing in the adjacent cities or villages; that in particular water and air pollution is not only continued to the immediate area in which the pollution is generated, but the same affects other areas as well wherever water or air went; that this Court in Virender Gaur and Ors. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., invoked the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India to declare that the citizens have a fundamental right to live decently unaffected by pollution. 
5. However, some of the environmental activists, as noted in 'The Environmental Activities Hand Book' authored by Gayatri Singh, Kerban Ankleswaria and Colins Gonsalves, that the Judges are carried away by the money spent on projects and that mega projects, that harm the environment are not condemned. However, this criticism seems to be baseless since in Virender Gaur and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors., this Court insisted on the demolition of structure which have been constructed on the lands reserved for common purposes and that this Court did not allow its decision to be frustrated by the actions of a party. 
6. This Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of planned development of the cities and either approved the orders passed by the High Court or itself gave directions for demolition of illegal constructions -  Virender Gaur v. State of Haryana
7. It would, therefore, be clear that the meaning of the expression 'forest land' in the respective Acts requires extended meaning given so as to preserve forest land from deforestation to maintain ecology and to prevent environmental degradation and hazardous effects on right to life. In Virender Gaur v. State of Haryana this Court in paragraph 7 at pages 580-81: (of SCC): (at p. 309 of AIR SCW) has held that environmental, ecological, air, water pollution, etc. should be regarded as amounting to violation of right of life assured by Article 21.

Judgement 21: M.P. Oil Extraction and Anr. v. State of M.P. and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The appellants have been using sal seeds and rice bran as raw material in their solvent extraction plant since 1973. The appellants contended that the State Government was fully aware of the need of sal seeds for the old units like theirs. However, the High Court found no justification for any concessions to the old units and cancelled the agreements.
2. The main issues in this case were the legality and validity of the agreements made by the State Government with M/s Bastar Oil Mills and Industries Ltd. and M/s Sal Udyog (Pvt.) Ltd. and whether there was discrimination in the distribution of sal seeds.

Judgement 22: State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. Basant Nahata

Main Contention:
1. Whether the notification issued by the State of Rajasthan in exercise of power conferred under Section 22A of the Act is arbitrary and unconstitutional?
2. Power of Attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property. The power of attorney is creation of an agency whereby the grantor authorises the grantee to do the acts specified therein, on behalf of grantor, which when executed will be binding on the grantor as if done by him.

Category: Constitutional Law

Context: If the case involves the use of power of attorney in the context of real estate transactions, it could indirectly relate to environmental considerations tied to urban development. The legal status of land ownership and transfer mechanisms can have implications for conservation efforts. If land is transferred or used in a manner that is inconsistent with tribal interests or larger national environmental goals, it may be challenged under articles 14/21.

Citation Search Collation: 
1. The reliance placed in this regard by the Petitioners on the decision of this Court in State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata may not be appropriate. The said decision arose out of a challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 22A of the Registration Act, 1908 inserted by way of State Amendment by the State of Rajasthan. By the said amendment, the state government was conferred with unbridled powers to declare by notification in the official gazette, the registration of any document or class of documents as opposed to public policy.
2.  In State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. Basant Nahata, it was opined:
    ...In absence of any substantive provisions contained in a parliamentary or legislative act he cannot be refrained from dealing with his property in any manner he likes. Such statutory interdict would be opposed to one's right of property as envisaged under Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
3. We may notice that in State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. Basant Nahata, it was pointed out:
    The contention raised to the effect that this Court would not interfere with the policy decision is again devoid of any merit. A legislative policy must conform to the provisions of the constitutional mandates. Even otherwise a policy decision can be subjected to judicial review. (3 cases had the exact same statement: MANU/SC/1197/2006, MANU/SC/8630/2006 & MANU/SC/1654/2006)

--------------------------------------------------

Judgement 23: The State of Jammu & Kashmir vs. Shri Triloki Nath Khosa and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. It was held that dealing with practical exigencies a rule making authority may be guided by realities. This basically means that, when creating rules or regulations, the authority responsible for making those rules is permitted to take into account practical necessities or urgent needs. 
2. A legislative body has the authority and discretion to assess and categorize different levels or degrees of harm caused by a particular activity or behavior. In doing so, the legislature is also empowered to impose restrictions or regulations selectively, focusing on those instances where the need for intervention is considered most evident or compelling.

Category: Law making and interpretation (?)

Context: Environmental regulations often deal with practical exigencies related to ecological conservation, pollution control, and sustainable development. The principle of considering practical necessities may apply to crafting regulations that effectively address environmental challenges while accommodating the needs of the ecosystem. Urgent environmental needs, such as responding to environmental emergencies or addressing imminent threats to ecosystems, may require swift regulatory action. The principle of considering practical exigencies allows rule-making authorities to respond promptly to situations that demand urgent environmental intervention.

Citation Search Collation:
1. In The State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa and Ors., a Constitution Bench had held that the code of equality and equal opportunity is a charter for equals; equality of opportunity in matters of promotion means an equal promotional opportunity for persons who fall, substantially, within the same class. A classification of employees can, therefore, be made for first identifying and then distinguishing members of one class from those of another. 
2.  In The State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Shri Triloki Nath Khosa and Ors., the validity of such a classification came to be considered before this Court. Chandrachud, J., (as the learned Chief Justice then was), opined:
    ...Formal education may not always produce excellence but a classification founded on variant educational qualifications is, for purposes of promotion to the post of an Executive Engineer, to say the least, not unjust on the face of it and the onus therefore cannot shift from where it originally lay.
3. The doctrine of classification was not to be carried out to a point where instead of being a useful servant, it would become a dangerous master as otherwise, in the words of Y.V. Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) in the State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa "the guarantee of equality will be submerged in class legislation masquerading as laws meant to govern well-marked classes characterised by different and distinct attainments." There could not be an overemphasis on the doctrine of classification to deprive the guarantee of equality of its spacious content. 
4. In State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa this Court said that dealing with practical exigencies a rule-making authority may be guided by realities just as the legislature-
    Is free to, recognise degrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest.
5. To help the lagging social segments, by special care, is a step towards and not against a larger and stabler equality. I had occasion to observe in J. & K. State v. T. N. Khosa:
    In this unequal world the proposition that all men are equal has working limitations, since absolute equality leads to Procrustean cruelty or sanctions indolent inefficiency-Necessarily, therefore, an imaginative and constructive modus vivendi between commonness and excellence must be forged to make the equality clauses viable. This pragmatism produced the Judicial gloss of 'classification' and 'diffrentia', with the by products of equality among equals and dissimilar things having to be treated differently. The social meaning of Articles 14 - 16 is neither dull uniformity nor specious 'taleritism. 
6. Article 16(1) which ensures equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment has been described as an instance or incident of the general guarantee of equality contained in Article 14 
7. More recently, in the State of Jammu & Kashmir v. T. N. Khosa this Court has sounded a note of caution:
    ...let us not evolve, through imperceptible extensions, a theory of classification which may subvert, perhaps submerge, the precious guarantee of equality. The eminent spirit of an ideal society is equality and so we must not be left to ask in wonderment: what after all is the operational residue of equality and equal opportunity?
8. In State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa it was observed by this Court:
    Since the Constitutional code of equality and equal opportunity is a charter for equals, equality of opportunity in matters of promotion means an equal promotional opportunity for persons who fall, substantially, within the same class. A classification of employees can therefore be made for find identifying and then distinguishing members of one class from those of another.
9. Classification on the basis of educational qualifications made with a view to achieve administrative efficiency cannot be said to rest on any fortuitous circumstances and one has always to bear in mind the facts and circumstances of the case in order to judge the validity of a classification. In the case of State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Sh. Triloki Nath Khosa and Ors., it was noted that intelligible differentia and rational nexus are the twin tests of reasonable classification.

Judgement 24: Rustom Cavasjee Cooper and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI)

Main Contention:
1. Whether a shareholder could file a Writ petition for the violation of his Fundamental Rights, when the company in which he is a shareholder is acquired by the Government?
2. Whether the Ordinance in question had been properly made or not? Whether the method of ascertaining the compensation was valid or not?
3. Whether the Act was within the jurisdiction of the Parliament to get formulated or not? Whether the impugned Act was violative of Article 19(1)(g) and Article 31(2) of the Constitution of India or not?

Category: Banking

Context: Assessing compensation for the acquisition may involve considerations of environmental damage or the potential for future environmental liabilities. Questions about the validity of the method of ascertaining compensation may indirectly relate to how environmental impacts and risks are taken into account. Shareholders raising concerns about the violation of their fundamental rights may indirectly raise questions about environmental justice. If the acquisition negatively impacts the environment, shareholders might argue that their rights to a healthy environment or access to information about environmental risks are being violated.

Citation Search Collation:
1. Such a power conferred upon the statutory authority being wholly arbitrary as thereby unbridled power has been conferred, the same must also be held ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution. Mr. Sanghi would urge that the statute cannot be construed only with reference to its objective sought to be achieved without considering the constitutionality thereof. Strong reliance in this behalf has been placed on Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India
2. While considering the validity of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Ordinance 1969, this Court in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India at page 294 observed as under:-
    "It is again not for this Court to consider the relative merits of the different political theories or economic policies...
    This Court has the power to strike down a law on the ground of want of authority, but the Court will not sit in appeal over the policy of the Parliament in enacting a law..."
3. It is further held in this decision that it is not for the Judges to seek to develop new all-embracing principles of law in a way that reflects the stance and opinion of the individual judges when the society/legislature as a whole are unclear and substantially divided on the relevant issues. Reliance is also placed on Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India, restating the above principle and observing that the Court will not sit in appeal over the policy of Parliament in enacting a law.
4. One of the earliest pronouncements on the subject came from this Court in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India wherein this Court held that it is not the forum where conflicting policy claims may be debated; it is only required to adjudicate the legality of a measure which has little to do with relative merits of different political and economic theories.
5. The perception changed when the Court focussed on the actual impairment caused by the law rather than the literal validity of the law as has been observed in I.R. Coelho (supra). I.R. Coelho referred to Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India
6. This is unconscionable. No civilised society would expect or require or steal someone's property for their betterment and the Rule of Equality requires the beneficiary to share the costs. Appellants rely on Rustom Cavasjee Cooper (Banks Nationalisation) v. Union of India. The Appellant would pray that the Rule be declared null and void and it be declared that the ownership of the OSR lands revert back to the Appellants.
7. Responding to the contention that Respondents compromised with public trust by entrusting the decision of new construction/renovation to the consultant, it is submitted that the task of making a Master Plan or of deciding whether or not a new building is required was never entrusted to the consultant and it was a conscious decision taken by the Government after consultation with all relevant entities. To support their position, the Respondents have placed reliance upon Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India

Judgement 25: His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Anr.

Main Contention:
1. He challenged the Kerala land reforms legislation in 1970, which imposed restrictions on the management of the religious property.
2. The case was challenged under Article 26, concerning the right to manage religiously owned property without government interference.

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: The management and use of land, especially in the context of religious properties, can have environmental implications. The case may indirectly touch upon questions related to how the use of land, even for religious purposes, aligns with environmental conservation. Article 26, which concerns the right to manage religiously owned property, might indirectly relate to the preservation of cultural landscapes. Religious properties often have cultural and historical significance and these might directly contradict with the environmental conservation goals.

Citation Search Collation: 
1. Constitutional Bench judgments in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala and Anr. have uniformly ruled that the doctrine of separation of powers, though not specifically engrafted, is constitutionally entrenched and forms part of the basic structure as its sweep, operation and visibility are apparent. Constitution has made demarcation, without drawing formal lines, amongst the three organs with the duty of the judiciary to scrutinise the limits and whether or not the limits have been transgressed.
2. It is also a fundamental proposition of construction that the effect of deletion of words must receive serious consideration while interpreting a statute as this has been repeatedly affirmed by this Court in a series of judgments.
3. We find that if we were to do that, we would have set ourselves on the path to ineradicably alter the identity of our Constitution, damage its very purposes and the national project, and wipe out decades worth of jurisprudence with regard to the importance of Directive principles of State Policy, thereby bringing back the principles, that none of the fundamental rights can be abridged or affected in any manner, which was set aside by this Court in Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala.
4. Similar sentiments were expressed by Justice K. K. Mathew in series of lectures incorporated in the form of a book titled "Democracy, Equality and Freedom" in which it is stated that "the strength of judicial review lies in case to case adjudication." This is precisely why this Court in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharti Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala and Anr. quoting from an American decision, observed as follows:
    1695...The reason why the expression "due process" has never been defined is that it embodies a concept of fairness which has to be decided with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case and also according to the mores for the time being in force in a society to which the concept has to be applied. As Justice Frankfurter said, "due process" is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances
5. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, this Court has observed as under:
    292. The learned Attorney-General said that every provision of the Constitution is essential; otherwise, it would not have been put in the Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of the Constitution in the same position. The true position is that every provision of the Constitution can be amended provided in the result the basic foundation and structure of the constitution remains the same.
6. It was held in the case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala as under:
    584. The later decisions had continued to uphold the concept of "compensation" i.e. just equivalent of the value of the property acquired in spite of the amendments made in 1955. In State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas and Ors. the decision in Metal Corporation of India, was overruled which itself was virtually overruled by R.C. Cooper v. Union of India. According to the Advocate-General of Maharashtra, if Shantilal Mangaldas case, had not been overruled by R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, there would have been no necessity of amending Article 31(2).
    ....
    1744. In the Bank Nationalisation case, the majority decision virtually overruled the decision in Gujarat v. Shantilal. The majority was of the view that even after the Fourth Amendment 'compensation' meant "the equivalent in terms of money of the property compulsorily acquired" according to "relevant principles" which principles must be appropriate to the determination or compensation for the particular class of property sought to be acquired.
Since compensation for acquisition of land need to be reasonable and adequate in the interest of justice, we rely upon the decision of Kesavananda Bharathi case (supra) to hold that returning 35% of land in lieu of acquisition is constitutionally impermissible.

Judgement 26: The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. It was submitted on the behalf of the appellants that the Bihar Sales Tax Act is ultra-vires, wholly illegal and in contravention of Article 286 of the Constitution to the extent that it proposes to tax a non-resident dealer with regard to an inter-State sale or purchase of goods.  
2. It was urged that Article 286 puts a restriction on the State legislature and did not confer any power on the state legislature to impose the tax. 
3. It was held that until Parliament by law provides otherwise, the State of Bihar shall abstain from imposing sales tax on out of state dealers in respect of sales or purchases that have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce even though the goods have been delivered as a direct result of such sales or purchases for consumption in Bihar.

Category: Taxation

Context: Restrictions on the taxation of inter-State trade can influence the flow of goods across State borders. This, in turn, affects transportation patterns, which have environmental implications. Economic activities, if concentrated in specific regions due to taxation considerations, may have corresponding environmental impacts. For example, industrial activities driven by tax incentives in certain regions may lead to localized environmental challenges.

1. Whether the writ petition is premature?
This issue is answered in favour of the Petitioner as the Petitioner has approached this Court at a time when its right to be considered along with POSCO has been threatened to be infringed by the action of the State, which, according to the Petitioner, is illegal and contrary to the statutory provision. So the Petitioner prayed for preferential right under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
Hence the writ petition cannot be said to be premature as the Petitioner could not have waited till the harm is caused to him
2. A seven-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Bengal Immunity Co. Limited v. State of Bihar and Ors., was considering the question as to whether the majority decision in the case of State of Bombay and Anr. v. United Motors (India) Limited and Ors. laid down a correct law. The authority of the court to go beyond the majority decision was questioned.
3. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Bengal Immunity v. State of Bihar and Ors., held that legal fictions are created only for some definite purpose. A legal fiction is to be limited to the purpose for which it was created, and it would not be legitimate to travel beyond the scope of that purpose, and read into the provision, any other purpose how so attractive it may be.
4. Rule 74(3) of the 2019 Rules, is relied upon to contend that it creates a legal fiction that anything done under the Rules/Regulations, is deemed to have been done under the 2019 Regulations. Reliance is placed on judgment in Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. State of Bihar and Ors.
5. The application of the Heydon's Rule could adequately aid us here as the Rule directs adoption of that construction which "shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy" as was pertinently observed by Justice S.R. Das, for a seven judge bench in Bengal Immunity Co. v. State of Bihar,
    ...the office of all judges is to make such construction as shal suppresses the mischief and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief; and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico.
6. But in so construing the fiction it is not to be extended beyond the purpose for which it is created [Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar], or beyond the language of the Section by which it is created.

Judgement 27: Deepak Kumar and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The Court held that eases of minor minerals including their renewal for an area of less than five hectares be granted by the States/Union Territories only afer getng ‘environmental clearance from the MoEF. The Court observed that sand mining on either side of the rivers, upstream and in-stream, is one of the causes for environmental degradaton and also a threat to the biodiversity.
2. While proposals for mining of major minerals typically undergo environment impact assessment and environmental clearance procedure, due attention had not been given to environmental aspects of mining of minor minerals.
3. Highly necessary to have an effectve framework of mining plan which will take care of all environmental issues and also evolve a long term rational and sustainable use of natural resource base and also the bio-assessment protocol.

Judgement 28: T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Petition to halt illegal timber operations in the area out of concern for the destruction of the Sandalwood Forest and Sandalwood becoming an endangered species.
2. The case was concerned with the question of whether sandalwood could be stated to be an endangered species and declared as a “specified plant”. The court found it did, and all licenses with wood-based industries were canceled. 
3. The court ruled in favor of Thirumulpad, directing sustainable use of the forest. The ruling also established an implementation system.

Judgement 29: Minerva Mills Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Whether insertion made under Article 31C and Article 368 through sections 4 and 55 of the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 does hamper the basic structure doctrine? Whether the Directive Principle of the State policy has primacy over Fundamental right to the Indian Constitution?   
2. The Court held that the Parliament can amend the Constitution without hampering the basic structure doctrine. The Parliament can amend fundamental rights as long as they are in consonance of the basic structure doctrine. The Court struck down the part which restricted the Judicial Review. 

Category: Consitutional Law

Context: The case touches upon the interplay between Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Rights. In the context of environmental issues, this can be relevant in balancing the state's responsibility to pursue policies for environmental protection (Directive Principles) with individual rights (Fundamental Rights) that may be implicated by environmental regulations.  The case's affirmation that Parliament can amend fundamental rights while adhering to the basic structure doctrine may influence the way constitutional provisions are interpreted in environmental matters.

Citation Search Collation:
1. In determining the constitutionality or validity of a constitutional provision, the court must weigh the real impact and effect thereof, on the fundamental rights. The Court would not allow the legislature to overlook a constitutional provision by employing indirect methods. In Minerva Mills Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., this Court mandated without ambiguity, that it is the Constitution which is supreme in India and not the Parliament. The Parliament cannot damage the Constitution, to which it owes its existence, with unlimited amending power.
2. It was held by this Court in S.P. Sampath Kumar (supra) that in place of a High Court, the Parliament can set up an effective alternative institutional mechanism with the power of judicial review vested in it, by placing reliance on the observation made in Minerva Mills Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.
3. It is put forth by him that Under Article 136 power of judicial review is conferred on this Court by the Constitution of legislative action, judicial decision and administrative action and the said power of judicial review is the basic feature of the Constitution which cannot be curtailed by a statutory provision as enshrined Under Sections 6(2) and 11 of the 1956 Act. For the aforesaid purpose, learned senior Counsel has commended us to the authorities in Minerva Mills Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.
4. In Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, the Constitution Bench had held that the edifice of our Constitution is built upon the concept crystallised in the Preamble. We "the People" resolved to constitute ourselves a socialist State which carries with it the obligation to secure to the people, justice -- social, economic and political. We, therefore, put Part IV in to our Constitution containing Directive Principles of State policy which specifies the socialistic role to be achieved.
5. When a law is patently arbitrary, such infringement of the equality clause contained in Article 14 or Article 16 would be violative of the equality clause of the Constitution.
6. Violation of fundamental rights cannot be justified by the State on grounds of administrative convenience in meeting its obligations under the Directive Principles of State Policy. Protection of fundamental rights is essential for public welfare contemplated under the Directive Principles of State Policy. This has been upheld in various cases such as Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, where Y.V. Chandrachud, C.J. observed:
    57. (...) just as the rights conferred by Part III would be without a radar and a compass if they were not geared to an ideal, in the same manner the attainment of the ideals set out in Part IV would become a pretence for tyranny if the price to be paid for achieving that ideal is human freedoms.

Judgement 30: Ashok Lanka and Anr. v. Rishi Dixit and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The trade in country/foreign liquor is considered outside the realm of ordinary commercial activities. the state holds the exclusive privilege to engage in the trade of liquor, encompassing activities from manufacturing to distribution and from sale to consumption. 
2. Citizens do not have a fundamental right to engage in the trade of liquor. The state can part with its exclusive privilege to engage in the liquor trade, but when it does so, it charges a price referred to as "excise duty."

Category: Taxation and Constitutional Law (?)

Context: The case mentions that when the state partakes in the liquor trade, it charges excise duty. The levying of excise duty on environmental products can influence consumer behavior. If excise duty is levied on environmentally friendly products, it may act as an incentive for businesses and consumers to adopt eco-friendly practices.

1. Two parallel proceedings, it is well settled, cannot be allowed to continue at the same time. A construction of a statute which may lead to such a situation, therefore, must be avoided. It will also lead to an absurdity if two different Tribunals are allowed to come to contradictory decisions. Furthermore, it is a well-known principle of law that where literal interpretation shall give rise to an anomaly or absurdity, the same should be avoided.
2. We would accept the proposition of law as propounded by this Court in Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee and Anr. v. C.K. Rajan and Ors. In that case it was, inter alia, observed that public interest litigation procedures may be adopted in a case where initially the writ petition was filed as a private interest litigation.
3. In Ashok Lanka v. Rishi Dixit, this Court opined:
    ...it is well settled that even in a case where a petitioner might have moved the Court in his private interest and for redressal of personal grievances, the Court in furtherance of the public interest may treat it necessary to enquire into the state of affairs of the subject of litigation in the interest of justice.
4. In Ashok Lanka and Anr. v. Rishi Dixit and Ors., it was held:
    ...We are not oblivious of the fact that framing of rules is not an executive act but a legislative act; but there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that such subordinate legislation must be framed strictly in consonance with the legislative intent as reflected in the rule-making power contained in Section 62 of the Act.
5. It is equally well-settled that the Parliament must be held to have intended to lay down a reasonable statute unless a plain meaning of the Act leads to different conclusion. It is trite that a statute must be read reasonably. 
6. While we are not oblivious of the fact that nobody has any fundamental right to carry on business in toddy or liquor, but all the licensees are entitled to be treated equally. If the matter of validity or otherwise of the subordinate legislation is to be considered, Article 14 of the Constitution of India shall be attracted.

Judgement 31: State of Uttaranchal v. Balwant Singh Chaufal and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The importance of the judgment lies on the fact that it raises certain interesting issues about the need to regulate the field of public interest litigations. The filing of indiscriminate petitions creates unnecessary strain on the judicial system and consequently leads to inordinate delay in disposal of genuine and bona fide cases. 
2. The courts' contribution in helping the poorer sections by giving a new definition to life and liberty and in protecting ecology, environment and forests is extremely significant. This  was being blatantly abused by filing some petitions with oblique motives.
3. The courts must encourage genuine and bona fide PIL and effectively discourage and curb the PIL filed for extraneous considerations.
4. Instead of every individual judge devising his own procedure for dealing with the public interest litigation, it would be appropriate for each High Court to properly formulate rules for encouraging the genuine PIL and discouraging the PIL filed with oblique motives.
5. The courts should prima facie verify the credentials of the petitioner before entertaining a P.I.L. The court should be fully satisfied that substantial public interest is involved before entertaining the petition.
6. The court should ensure that the petition which involves larger public interest, gravity and urgency must be given priority over other petitions

Category: Public Interest Litigation

Context: The case highlights the strain on the judicial system caused by indiscriminate PILs. In the context of environmental cases, this strain can impact the timely disposal of matters related to environmental protection, conservation, and ecological issues. The need for efficient handling of PILs aligns with the urgency often associated with environmental concerns. The acknowledgment of the courts' significant role in protecting ecology, environment, and forests underscores the importance of PILs in addressing environmental issues

Citation Search Collation:
1. We may also point out that as a matter of prudence and not as a rule of law, the court may confine this strategic exercise of jurisdiction to cases where legal wrong or legal injury is caused to a determinate class or group of persons or the constitutional or legal right of such determinate class or group of persons is violated and as far as possible, not entertain cases of individual wrong or injury at the instance of a third party, where there is an effective legal-aid organisation which can take care of such cases.
The relevant para from Balwant Singh's case is extracted hereunder
    33. The High Courts followed this Court and exercised similar jurisdiction Under Article 226 of the Constitution. The Courts expanded the meaning of right to life and liberty guaranteed Under Article 21 of the Constitution. The rule of locus standi was diluted and the traditional meaning of "aggrieved person" was broadened to provide access to justice to a very large section of the society which was otherwise not getting any benefit from the judicial system. We would like to term this as the first phase or the golden era of the public interest litigation. We would briefly deal with important cases decided by this Court in the first phase after broadening the definition of "aggrieved person".
2. Further in a recent decision, in the case of State of Uttaranchal v. Balwant Singh Chaufal and Ors., the Supreme Court referring to large number of its earlier decisions held as under:
    33. The High Courts followed this Court and exercised similar jurisdiction Under Article 226 of the Constitution. The Courts expanded the meaning of right to life and liberty guaranteed Under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Rule of locus standi was diluted and the traditional meaning of "aggrieved persons" was broadened to provide access to justice to a very large Section of the society which was otherwise not getting any benefit from the judicial system. We would like to term this as the first phase or the golden era of the public interest litigation. We would briefly deal with important cases decided by this Court in the first phase after broadening the definition of "aggrieved person"
3. He has highlighted the points taken note of by the High Court in the impugned judgment and supported the conclusion reached by the High Court in setting aside notifications Under Section 3A(1) of the 1956 Act. The learned Counsel had relied upon the decisions of this Court in Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (supra) and State of Uttaranchal v. Balwant Singh Chaufal and Ors.
4. The constitutional courts have time and again reiterated that abuse of the noble concept of PIL is increasing day-by-day and to curb this abuse there should be explicit and broad guidelines for entertaining petitions as PILs. This Court in State of Uttaranchal v. Balwant Singh Chaufal and Ors., has given a set of illustrative guidelines, inter alia:
    (i) The court should be prima facie satisfied regarding the correctness of the contents of the petition before entertaining a PIL.
    (ii) The court should also ensure that there is no oblique motive behind filing the public interest litigation etc. etc.
Therefore, while dealing with the PIL, the Court has to be vigilant and it must ensure that the forum of the Court be neither abused nor used to achieve an oblique purpose.
5. Public Interest Litigation was a novel form adopted by this Court in the late 1970's and the early 1980's to hear the grievances of the vast Section of the society which were poor, marginalized and had no means to reach the Supreme Court for articulating their grievance. It was thus the Public Interest Litigation which became the means by which a voice was given to this large voiceless Section of our society
6. This Court in Balwant Singh Chaufal (supra) while dealing with origin and development of PIL in this country has divided its growth into three phases which has been given in its Para 43 as under:
    Phase-I: It deals with cases of this Court where directions and orders were passed primarily to protect fundamental rights Under Article 21 of the marginalized groups and Sections of the society who because of extreme poverty, illiteracy and ignorance cannot approach this Court or the High Courts.
    Phase-II: It deals with the cases relating to protection, preservation of ecology, environment, forests, marine life, wildlife, mountains, rivers, historical monuments etc. etc.
    Phase-III: It deals with the directions issued by the Courts in maintaining the probity, transparency and integrity in governance.
This Court then traced the abuse of the Public Interest Litigation and observed that this important jurisdiction has come to be abused, at the hands of ill motivated individuals, busy bodies and publicity seekers.

Judgement 32: State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh

Main Contention:
1. What is mala fides in the province of exercise of power? Is the acquisition proceeding in the instant case bad for bad faith?
2. The whole litigation is about a piece of land sought to be taken by the State to build a new mandi. Way back in 1962, a site apparently best suited was selected in Qadian and the then Chief Minister, Partap Singh Kairon laid the foundation stone, and a few poles erected there bear witness to this old ceremony.

Category: Land Acquisition

Context: Land acquisition for developmental projects, such as building a new mandi, can have environmental consequences. It may involve changes in land use, potential disruption of ecosystems, and alterations to the local environment. Assessing the mala fides in the acquisition process may indirectly involve considering the environmental impact and whether due diligence was exercised.

Citation Search Collation:
1. In this context, it is necessary to remember that the rules of natural justice have been ingrained in the scheme of Section 5A with a view to ensure that before any person is deprived of his land by way of compulsory acquisition, he must get an opportunity to oppose the decision of the State Government and/or its agencies/instrumentalities to acquire the particular parcel of land. At the hearing, the objector can make an effort to convince the Land Acquisition Collector to make recommendation against the acquisition of his land. He can also point out that the land proposed to be acquired is not suitable for the purpose specified in the notification issued under Section 4(1). Not only this, he can produce evidence to show that another piece of land is available and the same can be utilised for execution of the particular project or scheme.
2. In State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh, Krishna Iyer J. emphasized the necessity of reasonableness and fairness in the State action of invoking the urgency provision in the following words:
    16. ...it is fundamental that compulsory taking of a man's property is a serious matter and the smaller the man the more serious the matter. Hearing him before depriving him is both reasonable and pre-emptive of arbitrariness, and denial of this administrative fairness is constitutional anathema except for good reasons. Save in real urgency where public interest does not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not, having regard to Articles 14 (and 19), burke an enquiry under Section 17 of the Act. Here a slumbering process, pending for years and suddenly exciting itself into immediate forcible taking, makes a travesty of emergency power.
3. In The State of Punjab and Anr. v. Gurdial Singh and Ors., this Court held that when power is exercised in bad faith to attain ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate goal, it is called colourable exercise of power. The action becomes bad where the true object is to reach an end different from the one for which the power is entrusted, guided by an extraneous consideration, whether good or bad but irrelevant to the entrustment.
4. In State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh, the Court observed:
    ...it is fundamental that compulsory taking of a man's property is a serious matter and the smaller the man the more serious the matter. Hearing him before depriving him is both reasonable and pre-emptive of arbitrariness, and denial of this administrative fairness is constitutional anathema except for good reasons.
5. his Court in one occasion, in the case of The State of Punjab and Anr. v. Gurdial Singh and Ors., opined with respect to mala fide in jurisprudence of power, as under:
    9. The question, then, is what is mala fides in the jurisprudence of power? Legal malice is gibberish unless juristic clarity keeps it separate from the popular concept of personal vice. Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates the exercise of power sometimes called colourable exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps motives, passions and satisfactions is the attainment of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes" of power by simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate goal. If the use of the power is for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the actuation or catalysation by malice is not legicidal. 
6. it will be useful to notice the observations made in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh. In that case, while pronouncing upon the correctness of the order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had quashed the acquisition of the Respondents' land on the ground of malafide exercise of power, this Court observed:
    Legal malice is gibberish unless juristic clarity keeps it separate from the popular concept of personal vice. Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates the exercise of power -- sometimes called colourable exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps motives, passions and satisfactions -- is the attainment of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate goal. If the use of the power is for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the actuation or catalysation by malice is not legicidal.

Judgement 33: D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal

Main Contention:
1. Is there an increase in cases of custodial deaths and violence? Is there a need for guidelines governing the arrest and custody of detainees?
2. Should police officers be held responsible for custodial deaths and violence? Does custodial death and violence constitute a violation of Article 21 of the detainees’ rights?
3. It established guidelines to protect the rights and dignity of individuals in police custody. The Supreme Court emphasised the need for visible identification of police officers, the preparation of an arrest memo and the right of the detainee to have a friend or relative informed about their arrest.

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: The case's emphasis on protecting the rights and dignity of individuals in police custody extends to environmental activists and defenders. Establishing guidelines helps prevent potential abuse of power, ensuring that detention is carried out lawfully and without violence, thereby protecting activists from retaliatory measures. While the immediate focus is on custodial rights, the case indirectly reinforces the broader concept of human rights, including the right to a healthy environment. 

Citation Search Collation:
1. In respect of violations of human rights during investigation, in D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal, grave concern was expressed by this Court in respect of persons who were supposed to be the protectors of the citizens and committed violence under the shield of uniform and authority in the four walls of a Police Station or lockup, the victims being totally helpless. It will be useful to note what was said in para 18 which reads :
    "However, in spite of the constitutional and statutory provisions aimed at safeguarding the personal liberty and life of a citizen, growing incidence of torture and deaths in police custody has been a disturbing factor. Experience shows that worst violations of human rights take place during the course of investigation, when the police with a view to secure evidence or confession often resorts to third-degree methods including torture and adopts techniques of screening arrest by either not recording the arrest or describing the deprivation of liberty merely as a prolonged interrogation.
2. In D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal custodial torture and violence was described as a wound inflicted on the soul, so painful and paralysing that it engenders fear, rage, hatred and despair, and denigrates the individual.
3. If Section 24 of the Evidence Act was met, and the Court was satisfied that the confession so recorded was both voluntary and truthful. In any case, he asserted that the safeguards that have been pointed out in D.K. Basu v. Union of India. 
4. The breach of any one of these requirements would have a vital bearing on the admissibility and evidentiary value of the confession recorded Under Section 32(1) and may even inflict a fatal blow on such confession. We have another set of procedural safeguards laid down in Section 52 of POTA which are modelled on the guidelines envisaged by D.K. Basu. Section 52 runs as under:
    "52. (1) Where a police officer arrests a person, he shall prepare a custody memo of the person arrested.
    (2) The person arrested shall be informed of his right to consult a legal practitioner as soon as he is brought to the police station.
5. In a public interest litigation involving incidents of custodial violence in West Bengal, this Court issued guidelines for law enforcement agencies to follow when arresting and detaining any person. This Court also discussed the award of compensation as a remedy for violation of fundamental rights as a punitive measure against State action.
6. Such a view is also fortified by several landmark judgments of the Supreme Court such as D.K. Basu v. State of W.B. wherein the Court was concerned with the fundamental rights of only those persons who were put under arrest and which again formed a minuscule fraction of the total populace.

Judgement 34: Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi v. State of A.P. and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The appellants in this case complained about the systematic destruction of percolation, irrigation and drinking water tanks in their town, and alienation of the tank bed land to the Urban Development Authority and the A.P. Housing Board for the urban development of the land for housing purposes. 
2. They stated that the tanks were being put to use not only for irrigation purpose but also as lakes which were furthering percolation to improve the ground water table, thus serving the needs of the people in and around these tanks.
3. The court, after taking into account all these principles of law, and considering the competing claims of environment and the need for housing, disposed of the appeals with the directions, among others, that no further constructions was allowed to be made, each house already constructed had to provide structure for roof top rain water harvesting, all the storm water in the already built colonies had to be recharged to ground water and no borewell/ tubewell for any purpose was allowed in the area.

Judgement 35: In Re: The Kerala Education Bill, 1957. Reference Under Article 143(1) of The Constitution of India

Main Contention:
1. The Kerala Education Bill that was introduced in 1957 was presupposed to contain some provisions contrary to that of the rights of minorities. To clear the doubts raised in relation to the bill, the President under Article 143 of the Constitution seeks the opinion of the Supreme Court

Category: Constitutional Law, Fundamental Rights and Minority Rights

Context: While the case specifically concerns minority rights in education, the protection of minority rights is a broader constitutional principle. In the environmental context, this could be related to the rights of indigenous communities or minority groups affected by environmental policies. If the case discusses federalism, it could have relevance to environmental governance, especially considering that environmental issues often involve collaboration between central and state governments.

Citation Search Collation:
1. In Re. The Kerala Education Bill this Court observed at p. 1022:
    Nevertheless, in" determining the scope and ambit of the fundamental rights relied on by or on behalf of any person or body the court may not entirely ignore these directive principles of State policy laid down in Part IV of the Constitution but should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as possible.
2. There is a comity of coordinate constitutional instrumentalities geared to shared constitutional goals which persuades the judicature to sustain rather than slay, save where the breach is brazen, the transgression is plain or the effective co-existence of the fundamental right and the administrative scheme is illusory. This Court has, on former occasions; upheld executive and legislative action hovering "perilously near" but not plunging into unconstitutionality
3. The Court went on to hold that disobedience to Directive Principles cannot affect the legislative power of the State. So was the view taken in In Re: The Kerala Education Bill, 1957
4. According to the learned Counsel, it is evident from the format of the Reference that it does not express or suggest any 'doubt' as regards the question of fact or law relating to allocation of all natural resources, a sine-qua-non for a valid reference. In support of the proposition, learned Counsel placed reliance on observations in earlier references - In Re: The Kerala Education Bill, 1957 In Reference Under Article 143(1) Of The Constitution of India
5. By way of aside, the fluctuating fortunes of fundamental rights, when the proletarist and the proprietarist have asserted them in Court, partially provoke sociological research and hesitantly project the Cardozo thesis of sub-conscious forces in judicial noesis when the cycloramic review starts from Gopalan, moves on to In re Kerala Education Bill...

Judgement 36: A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras

Main Contention:
1. Revolved around the Preventive Detention Act of 1950, which allowed the government to detain individuals without trial if they were deemed to be a threat to national security.
2. The Court upheld the validity of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, with the exception of Section 14, which provided that the grounds of detention communicated to the detainee or any representation made by him against these grounds cannot be disclosed in a court of law.

Category: Constitutional Law (?) and Fundamental Rights

Context: The exception related to Section 14, which prohibits the disclosure of grounds of detention in court, might indirectly touch upon the theme of transparency. In environmental matters, transparency in government actions, especially concerning environmental policies and decisions, is crucial for public trust and accountability. The case also involves a balancing act between national security concerns and individual rights, and that is relevant while discussing the environmental policies.

Citation Search Collation:
1. In view of the fact that the factors governing the quality of life have been included in the expression "life" contained in Article 21 by reason of creative interpretation of the said provision by this Court, is it possible to argue that Article 21 does not provide for an absolute immunity? Article 21 does not only refer to the necessity to comply with procedural requirements, but also substantive rights of a citizen. It aims at preventive measures as well as payment of compensation in cases human rights of a citizen are violated.
2. It is evident that Article 21, though so framed as to appear as a shield operating negatively against executive encroachment over something covered by that shield, is the legal recognition of both the protection or the shield as well as of what it protects which lies beneath that shield. It has been, so interpreted as long ago as in A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras
3. In A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras, Kania C.J., said that in the right "to move freely throughout the territory of India" the emphasis was not on the free movement but on the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. The intention was to avoid any restriction being placed by the States hampering free movement throughout the territory of India.
4. The procedure established by law does not mean procedure, however, fantastic and oppressive or arbitrary which in truth and reality is no procedure at all [(A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras)]
5. The principles of severability was also discussed in the case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, wherein the Court observed that what we have to see is, whether the omission of the impugned portions of the Act will "change the nature or the structure or the object of the legislation".
6. In one of the earliest cases relating to the wisdom of Parliament in enacting a law, it was contended in A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras that the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was unconstitutional. Justice Das expressed the view that:
    The point to be noted, however, is that in so far as there is any limitation on the legislative power, the Court must, on a complaint being made to it, scrutinise and ascertain whether such limitation has been transgressed and if there has been any transgression the Court will courageously declare the law unconstitutional, for the Court is bound by its oath to uphold the Constitution. But outside the limitations imposed on the legislative powers our Parliament and the State Legislatures are supreme in their respective legislative fields and the Court has no authority to question the wisdom or policy of the law duly made by the appropriate legislature.
7. For, this Court in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, noted that the Court is obliged to consider the effect of the law on the citizens and whether the same impacts the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.

Judgement 37: Kharak Singh v. The State of U.P. and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. This was the first case before the Indian Supreme Court that recognised the right to privacy in any form. In this case, the majority judgment by the Supreme Court invalidated Regulation 236(b) of the U.P. Police Regulations that permitted nightly domiciliary visits by policemen to persons classified as habitual criminals.
2. The Court further noted that the domiciliary visits amounted to unauthorized intrusion into a person’s home and were in violation of the concept of ordered liberty and dignity of the individual, and therefore contravened the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21.

Category: Fundamental Rights

Context: The concept of unauthorized intrusion into a person's home, as deemed unacceptable by the court, can be paralleled in environmental justice. The case highlights the need to balance security measures with individual rights. In the environmental realm, this balance is crucial when governments implement measures to address environmental threats while respecting the rights of individuals and communities affected by such measures.

1. It seems to me that there can be little doubt that the right to travel and to go outside the country, which orders regulating issue, suspension or impounding, and cancellation of passports directly affect, must be included in rights to "personal liberty" on the strength of decisions of this Court giving a very wide ambit to the right to personal liberty
2. But there was no definite pronouncement made on this point since the question before the Court was not so much the interpretation of the words 'personal liberty' as the inter-relation between Article 19 and 21. It was in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors. that the question as to the proper scope and meaning of the expression 'personal liberty' came up pointedly for consideration for the first time before this Court.
3. In Kharak Singh's case the majority took the view that the word 'liberty' in Article 21 is qualified by the word 'personal' and there its content is narrower and the qualifying adjective has been employed in order to avoid overlapping between those elements or incidents of liberty like freedom of speech or freedom of movement etc. already dealt with in Article 19(1) and the liberty guaranteed by Article 21 and particularly in the context of the difference between the permissible restraints or restrictions which might be imposed by sub Clauses (2) to (6) of the Article of the several species of liberty dealt with in a several clauses of Article 19(1). 
4. It is put forth that the concept of sustenance of individual autonomy inheres in the right of privacy and also comes within the fundamental conception of liberty. To sustain the stand of privacy, reliance has been placed on the decisions in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors.
5. Article 21 of the Constitution mandates that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty, except according to the procedure established by law. This Article has been interpreted by the Court in most expansive terms, particularly when it comes to the meaning that is assigned to 'right to life'. It is not necessary to take stock of various faces of right to life defined by this Court. What is important for our purpose is to point out that right to life has been treated as more than 'mere animal existence'. In Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors. it was held that the word 'life' in Article 21 means right to live with human dignity and it does not merely connote continued drudgery.
6. The public interest in the reservation and preservation of open spaces for parks and play grounds cannot be sacrificed by leasing or selling such sites to private persons for conversion to some other user. Any such act would be contrary to the legislative intent and inconsistent with the statutory requirements. Furthermore, it would be in direct conflict with the constitutional mandate to ensure that any State action is inspired by the basic values of individual freedom and dignity and addressed to the attainment of a quality of life which makes the guaranteed rights a reality for all the citizens. 
7. In Khadak Singh v. State of Himachal Pradesh, this Court has observed that the right to life is not merely an animal's existence. Under Article 21, the right to life includes the right to live with dignity.
8. Further, privacy is considered as a subset of personal liberty thereby accepting the minority opinion in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors.

Judgement 38: State of Bihar v. Banshi Ram Modi and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. Bansi Ram Modi was granted a mining lease for mining and winning mica in respect of an area of eighty acres of land in two villages of district Hazaribagh. The said lease was to expire on April 24, 1986. During mining operations, Bansi Ram Modi came across two other minerals, namely, feldspar and quartz, which are commonly known to be associate minerals of mica.
2. The respondent Bansi Ram Modi was then informed that as previous approval of the Central Government had not been obtained for inclusion of feldspar and quartz in the mining lease, as was required by the 1980 Act, he could not be permitted to win those two new minerals. The High Court accepted the writ petition holding that Bansi Ram Modi could win and take away feldspar and quartz from the mining area, as the lease had been executed'' in his favour earlier to 1980. 
3. Explanation to Section 2 of the Act defines "non-forest purpose" as breaking up or clearing of any forest land or portion thereof for any purpose other than reafforestation. Reading them together, these two parts of the section mean that after the commencement of the Act no fresh breaking up of the forest land or no fresh clearing of the forest on any such land can be permitted by any State Government or any authority without the prior approval of the Central Government.

Judgement 39: S. Jagannath v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors. 

Main Contention:
1. This case dealt with the ecological and social implications of commercial shrimp farming in India. A large number of private companies and multi-national corporations had started investing in shrimp farms. Within a few years more than eighty thousand hectares of land had been converted to shrimp farming.
2. The court emphasized that the new trend of more intensified shrimp farming - without much control of feeds, seeds and other inputs and water management practices - had brought to the fore a serious threat to the environment and ecology. 
3. Agricultural lands were being converted into commercial aquaculture farms, which had caused unemployment to the landless labourers and also loss of cultivable land. Sustainable development should be the guiding principle for the shrimp aquaculture.

Judgement 40: M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (UOI)

Main Contention:
1. On 4th December 1985, an incident of a major leakage of oleum gas happened from one of the units of Shriram. The leakage physically affected many common public – both the workmen as well as common people outside. Moreover, an advocate practising in the Tis Hazari Court died after inhaling oleum gas. The incident was confirmed by both the petitioner and the Delhi Bar Association. After two days, another minor leakage of oleum gas took place from the joints of a pipe on 6th December.
2. Due to the subsequent two incidents of oleum gas leakage, the Delhi administration immediately responded by issuing an order which directed Shriram to take the following steps:
    i. To stop using harmful chemicals and gases in the unit within two days.
    ii. Remove the said chemicals to a safer place within seven days and not keep or store the chemicals in the same place where the disaster happened again;

Judgement 41: Tata Cellular v. Union of India (UOI)

Main Contention:
1. The Supreme Court stipulated that judicial review is
concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision but the decision-making process itself. If an administrative decision is allowed to be reviewed, it will replace its own decision which could be fallible by itself. The court's duty is to confine itself to the question of legality.
2. The aim should be:
    i. Whether the decision-making authority exceeds its power.
    ii. Committed an error of law.
    iii. Committed a breach of the rules of natural justice.
    iv. Reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal would have reached.
    v. Abuse its power
3. Arbitrariness based on proportionality theory is still without foundation. There is also no basis for not justifying the administrative action on merit. Court must confine itself to the manner in which it made a decision or issued an order. It is not about the merits of the decision at all. 

Category: Administrative Law

Context: In the environmental context, regulatory bodies and government agencies make decisions that impact ecosystems, natural resources, and communities. The principles outlined in the case can guide legal scrutiny, ensuring that decisions align with legal powers, procedural fairness, and the rule of law. Environmental decisions often affect local communities. The case's criterion of whether a reasonable tribunal would have reached a particular decision can be applied to assess whether decisions take into account the concerns and inputs of affected communities.

1.  The principles which have to be applied in judicial review of administrative decisions, especially those relating to acceptance of tender and award of contract, have been considered in great detail by a three-Judge Bench in Tata Cellular v. Union of India
2. While arriving at the aforesaid conclusions, this Court took note of the illustrious case of Tata Cellular v. Union of India, it was noted as follows:
    77. The duty of the court is to confine itself to the question of legality. Therefore, it is not for the court to determine whether a particular policy or particular decision taken in the fulfillment of that policy is fair. It is only concerned with the manner in which those decisions have been taken. The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from case to case. Shortly put, the grounds upon which an administrative action is subject to control by judicial review can be classified as under:
        (i) Illegality : This means the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision- making power and must give effect to it.
        (ii) Irrationality, namely, Wednesday unreasonableness.
        (iii) Procedural impropriety. The above are only the broad grounds but it does not rule out addition of further grounds in course of time. As a matter of fact, in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex Brind, Lord Diplock refers specifically to one development, namely, the possible recognition of the principle of proportionality. In all these cases the test to be adopted is that the court should, "consider whether something has gone wrong of a nature and degree which requires its intervention.
3. The scope of judicial review has been succinctly explained by this Court in the case of Tata Cellular v. Union of India, which has been consistently followed in a catena of cases.
4. High Court exceeded its jurisdiction as it did not apply correct parameters of its power of judicial review as laid by this Court in Tata Cellular v. Union of India and other cases and the High Court went wrong in going into the question of expediency and wisdom of the proposed project.
5. It is a case where the High Court rightly interfered in exercise of its powers of judicial review keeping in view the principles laid by this Court in Tata Cellular v. Union of India
6. The High Court referred to how tender documents that reflected the nature of mine operations, how blasting is an inherent part and drilling is differently understood in the sense that the Appellant had understood. Thereafter, placing reliance on Tata Cellular v. Union of India, it came to hold that the decision taken by the owner was correct and did not adversely affect public interest but sub-served the public purpose.
7. t further observed that the matter would have been different had the Appellant, immediately after the tender notice was published, challenged the said condition after NIT was issued. The High Court placing reliance upon the decisions in Tata Cellular v. Union of India dismissed the writ petition.
8. It is equally impermissible for a Court to substitute its review in respect of highly complex factual technological and scientific issue. The Court cannot sit either an expert or arbitrate or as an appellate body nor can it allow a PIL petition to convert it into a super regulator. To reinforce the submission, reliance was placed on the ratio and observations made in the matter of Tata Cellular v. Union of India. It was submitted that unfortunately the impugned order has committed precisely the aforesaid errors repeatedly, inter alia in respect of size of lake and water level of the lake.

Judgement 42: Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The core of the allegations is that Shri Chadha, Shri G.P Hinduja and eleven other individuals mentioned as directors/employees/holders/beneficiaries of account code and public servants of the government of India, entered into a criminal conspiracy, obtained dirty gratification within the style of cash from BOFORS, a Swedish company through the agent firms/companies/persons.
2. This alleged gratification is said to be a motive or reward for public servants who, by corrupt or dishonest means or by exploiting their official positions, caused financial gain to themselves, BOFORS, the agents, and others by granting contracts to BOFORS for the supply of guns to the government of India. 
3. The suspects are accused of committing offenses including criminal breach of trust, cheating the Union of India, forgery, and using forged documents. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has initiated an investigation into the matter. During the course of the investigation, the CBI has recorded statements from witnesses and taken into custody various documents and files related to the BOFORS deal.

Category: Corruption (?)

Context: If the defense deal involves projects with potential environmental impact, corruption and dishonest practices could compromise the integrity of environmental safeguards. The principles applied in investigating corruption in defense deals can be extended to environmental projects. Ensuring fairness and transparency in the procurement process for environmental initiatives is crucial to prevent corruption. The case underscores the significance of ethical conduct in decision-making processes involving public servants. This principle is equally applicable to decisions related to environmental policies, regulations, and projects.

1. Having considered the merits, we need not go into the objection raised on behalf of the Respondents that the petition was for political gains and should not be looked into in view of Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary and Ors.
2. While this Court has laid down a chain of notable decisions with all emphasis at their command about the importance and significance of this newly developed doctrine of PIL, it has also hastened to sound a red alert and a note of severe warning that courts should not allow its process to be abused by a mere busybody or a meddlesome interloper or wayfarer or officious intervener without any interest or concern except for personal gain or private profit or other oblique' consideration
3. In the case of Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary, the Supreme Court taking note of the observations made in the case of S.P. Gupta (supra) and number of its earlier decisions, held as under:
    It is thus clear that only a person acting bona fide having sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will alone have a locus standi and can approach the court to wipe out the tears of the poor and needy, suffering from violation of their fundamental rights, but not a person for personal gain or private profit or political motive or any oblique consideration. Similarly, a vexatious petition under the colour or PIL brought before the court for vindicating any personal grievance, deserves rejection at the threshold.
4. Measuring the 'seriousness' of the PIL Petitioner and to see whether she/he is actually a 'champion' of the cause of the individual or the group being represented, is the responsibility of the Court, to ensure that the party's procedural behaviour remains that of an adequate 'champion' of the public cause.
5. In Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary and Ors. the court rightly cautioned that expanded role of courts in modern `social' state demand for greater judicial responsibility. The PIL has given new hope of justice-starved millions of people of this country. The court must encourage genuine PIL and discard PIL filed with oblique motives.

Judgement 43: Indian Handicrafts Emporium and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. In this case the petitioner had challenged the constitutional validity of Amendment Act 44, 1991, to the Constitution of India, which prohibited trade in imported ivory. 
2. The Court reasoned, that trade in imported ivory being dangerous to ecology has been regulated by imposing total prohibition by Wildlife (Protection) Amending Act of 1991. Such Amending Act indirectly seeks to protect Indian Elephant and to arrest their further depletion.
3. The Supreme Court held that the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1991 indirectly seeks to protect Indian elephant and to restrict its further depletion, and so, the appellant petition was dismissed.

Judgement 44: Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr.

Main Contention:
1. The Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra case of 2002 was a case of a matrimonial discord. In the case, the validity regarding the decree of a divorce was heard by the Supreme Court following the withdrawal of consent by Rupa Ashok Hurra despite earlier giving her consent for mutual divorce.
2. The first known instance of a curative petition was during the Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra case in 2002. The question arose whether the aggrieved party was entitled to any relief regarding the final judgement of the Supreme Court.
3. It was then decided that in order to prevent the misuse of its process and prevent any incident of a miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court would reconsider its judgement within the limits of its power. Thus the term ‘curative petition’ was derived.

Category: Constitutional Law (?)

Context: The establishment of the curative petition as a legal mechanism to prevent miscarriage of justice can be indirectly relevant to environmental disputes. Environmental decisions and policies often undergo judicial review. The introduction of a curative petition mechanism emphasizes the judiciary's commitment to ensuring fair and just outcomes, even after a final judgment. 

Citation Search Collation:
1. This Court dismissed the petition, by order dated 18.7.2002, having regard to the principles laid down in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr.
2. The learned Judge observes that in case of a decision, the appellate structure is exhausted after a pronouncement by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the only option left to the parties is of review or curative jurisdiction (a remedy carved out in the judgment in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr.). After the exercise of those limited options, the concerned parties have absolutely no relief with regard to the dispute; it is considered settled for eternity in the eyes of the law. However what is not eternal and still malleable in the eyes of law is the opinion or "view of law" pronounced in the course of reaching the decision.
3. The preliminary objection was on the very maintainability of a curative petitions after two decades of the settlement. It was submitted that this was in breach of the principles enshrined in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr. wherein this Court had specified very limited contours for its curative jurisdiction.
4. It is further propounded by Mr. Rohatgi that the 1956 Act framed by Parliament is a complete code in itself and if the scheme of the said Act is scrutinized and appreciated in proper perspective, it is clear as crystal that this Court has no jurisdiction to exercise the appellate power by granting leave. Elucidating the said aspect, it is contended by him that once the statutory provision postulates that the award has the same force as that of the decree of this Court, there cannot be an appeal assailing the same, for the simon pure reason that the concept of intra-court appeal is alien to the adjudicatory process of this Court and remotely not conceived of under the constitutional scheme or by any precedent. For the said purpose, he has drawn inspiration from the authority in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr.
5. Being the highest court of the land, this Court possesses powers to correct a judgment in a curative petition if the parameters laid down in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr. are satisfied. The present case does not fall within the parameters laid down in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr.

Judgement 45: Modern Dental College and Research Centre and Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The appellants, private unaided medical and dental colleges or associations of such colleges in the State of Madhya Pradesh, seek permission to fill the non-resident Indian (NRI) seats at their discretion. In case sufficient students are not available, the appellants request the liberty to admit other students within the NRI quota, subject to maintaining inter se merit amongst the students admitted against the said quota. 
2. Writ petitions challenging this Act are pending adjudication before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur. This Court has previously ordered that the same arrangement shall be continued for the academic year 2011-2012. 
3. The main question before the court is regarding the method and procedure for filling the unfilled NRI seats in medical and dental colleges. The petitioners’ arguments were rejected by the Supreme Court, which upheld the judgment of the High Court and the constitutional validity of the Act and Rules. 

Category: Constitutional Law (?)

Context: In the realm of environmental law, analogous principles could be applied to resource allocation and usage. For instance, environmental resources like water, land, or permits for certain activities might be subject to allocation policies. Qualifying these policies based on merit, adherence to environmental standards, and transparency could be crucial.It may indirectly impact resource allocation in a region. If the allocation of resources is not based on merit, it may lead to environmental degradation or inequitable distribution of resources.

Citation Search Collation:
1. On the question of proportionality, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners relies upon the four-pronged test summed up in the opinion of the majority in Modern Dental College and Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh. These four tests are 
    (i) that the measure is designated for a proper purpose 
    (ii) that the measures are rationally connected to the fulfillment of the purpose 
    (iii) that there are no alternative less invasive measures and 
    (iv) that there is a proper relation between the importance of achieving the aim and the importance of limiting the right.
The court in the said case held that a mere ritualistic incantation of "money laundering" or "black money" does not satisfy the first test and that alternative methods should have been explored.
2. This Court in Anuradha Bhasin held that the principle of proportionality is inherently embedded in the Indian Constitution under the doctrine of reasonable restriction, which means the limitation imposed on a person should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required in the interest of public.
3. However, the amended provision is excessive, irrational, arbitrary and falls foul of test of proportionality. It suffers from the vice of disproportionate restrictions and failure to provide fair procedure. To buttress the grounds of challenge, 
reliance was placed on Modern Dental College and Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh.
4. In Modern Dental College and Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh, a Constitution Bench of this Court while dealing with a challenge held that proportionality is the correct test to apply in the context of Article 19(6). Justice A K Sikri, speaking for the Court, held thus:
    60... the exercise that is required to be undertaken is the balancing of fundamental right to carry on occupation on the one hand and the restrictions imposed on the other hand. This is what is known as 'Doctrine of Proportionality'. Jurisprudentially, 'proportionality' can be defined as the set of Rules determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for limitation of a constitutionally protected right by a law to be constitutionally permissible.
5. In Modern Dental College and Research Centre and Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors., Dr. Sikri, J explaining the concept of proportionality laid down following in Paragraphs 64:
    64. The exercise which, therefore, to be taken is to find out as to whether the limitation of constitutional rights is for a purpose that is reasonable and necessary in a democratic society and such an exercise involves the weighing up of competitive values, and ultimately an assessment based on proportionality i.e. balancing of different interests.
6. The most elaborate consideration of the Doctrine of Proportionality was made in Modern Dental College and Research Centre and Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors.

Judgement 46: S.P. Gupta v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The central concern in SP Gupta vs Union of India revolved around the constitutional validity of the Central Government’s order regarding the non-appointment and short-term transfer of judges in High Courts. Furthermore, the case questioned the disclosure of correspondence between the Minister of Law, the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and the Chief Justice of India. 
2. Challenges to the standing (locus standi) of the petitioners were also raised. An equally significant issue pertained to the independence of the judiciary and the procedures governing the appointment of judges in higher courts.

Category: Constitutional Law (?)

Context: The case highlighted concerns about the independence of the judiciary. An independent judiciary is crucial for upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice in various domains, including environmental matters. The case involved questions about the disclosure of correspondence between government officials and the judiciary. Challenges to the standing (locus standi) of the petitioners were raised in the case. Similarly, in environmental law, the question of standing is crucial for access to justice.

2. The running of the Pathological Lab in the building by the Respondent-owners amount to violation of the rule of law and affects the public interest, therefore, it is public interest litigation even though the Appellant herein is a resident of the second floor of the concerned building and simultaneously he has been fighting for the cause of all the local residents. This legal principle has been laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of S.P. Gupta and Ors. v. President of India and Ors.
3. t has been repeatedly held by this Court that none has a right to approach the Court as a public interest litigant and that Court must be careful to see that member of the public, who approaches the Court in public interest, is acting bona fide and not for any personal gain or private profit or political motivation or other oblique considerations, {See S.P. Gupta v. Union of India and Anr.}
4. This Court in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India proceeded on the assumption that the independence of judiciary is the basic feature of the Constitution but failed to appreciate that the interpretation, it gave, was not in conformity with broader facets of the two concepts-'independence of judiciary' and 'judicial review'-which are interlinked.
5. Relying upon or on the basis of the decisions of this Court in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India the learned counsel would submit that the provisions contained in Section 18 of the Act are not valid law imposing reasonable restriction on such freedom in the interest of the State.
6. The case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, decided by a seven-Judge Constitution Bench of this Court, is generally considered as having broken new ground and having added a fresh, liberal dimension to the need for increased disclosure in matters relating to public affairs, In that case, the consensus that emerged amongst the Judges was that in regard to the functioning of Government, disclosure of information must be the ordinary rule while secrecy must be an exception, justifiable only when it is demanded by the requirement of public interest.
7. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in the case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, it is submitted that the High Court has rightly entertained the Public Interest Litigation petitions and has rightly quashed the entire acquisition proceedings. It is submitted that the High Court has rightly entertained and allowed the Public Interest Litigation petitions as by the acquisition of such a huge tract of land to the extent of 6000 acres, affecting 30,000 people, who were too weak, poor and disadvantaged, who could not approach the court for legal redress.

Judgement 47: R.K. Jain v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The Supreme Court affirmed a judgment by the Delhi High Court holding that Annual Confidential Reports (ACR) of a public officer constituted 'personal information' and 'third party information' and were therefore exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Right to Information Act, 2005.
2. The Court reasoned that information relating to charges, penalties or sanctions imposed on an employee and records containing information of such nature was necessarily a matter between employee and employer, the disclosure of which had no relationship to any public activity or public interest. 
3. The Court further noted that to disclose information of such a nature could cause an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The Court also reiterated that it was the prerogative of the competent authority to decide if such information could be disclosed in the greater public interest.

Category: Right to Information

Context: The case emphasizes the importance of protecting personal information, stating that disclosure could cause an unwarranted invasion of privacy. In environmental governance, where various stakeholders, including individuals and entities, are involved, there may be instances where personal information needs protection. The court's recognition of the prerogative of the competent authority to decide on disclosure in the greater public interest is relevant to environmental matters. Balancing the public's right to access information about environmental issues with the need to protect sensitive information. There is also a public interest in ensuring transparency and accountability in environmental governance. Access to information about environmental impact assessments, pollution levels, and other relevant data enables the public to hold authorities accountable for environmental protection.

1. The availability of expertise of judicial members in the Commission would facilitate the decision-making to be more practical, effective and meaningful, besides giving semblance of justice being done. The provision of eligibility criteria which does not even lay down any qualifications for appointment to the respective posts under the Act of 2005 would be unconstitutional, in terms of the judgments of this Court in the case of R.K Jain v. Union of India
2. The 2017 Rules were held to be contrary to the parent amendment and therefore, struck down. The Central Government was directed to reformulate the Rules strictly in accordance with the principles delineated by this Court in R.K. Jain v. Union of India
3. Pertinently, in matters of independence of the judiciary or arrangement of courts or tribunals, when these provisions come up for interpretation, this Court would apply a searching scrutiny standard in its judicial review to ensure that the new body, court, tribunal, commission or authority created to adjudicate (between citizens and government agencies or departments, citizens and citizens, or citizens and corporate entities) are efficient, efficacious and inspire public confidence. The role of courts in considering a provision of law setting up adjudicatory bodies, was recognized in R.K. Jain v. Union of India
4. The issue of direct appeals to the Supreme Court, or entertaining petitions Under Article 136 to challenge tribunal's decision, was considered in the case of R.K. Jain v. Union of India. In paragraph 76 of the said judgment, this Court addressed similar submission to the effect that appeal mechanism should be provided from a tribunal's decision, to a division bench of the High Court.

Judgement 48: Goa Foundation v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

Main Contention:
1. The State of Goa was obliged to grant fresh mining leases in accordance with law and not second renewals to the mining lease holders. Also, the State of Goa was not under any constitutional obligation to grant fresh mining leases through the process of competitive bidding or auction.
2. Showing dismay over large-scale illegal mining of iron ore and manganese ore in the State of Goa, the bench issued several directions to ensure implementation of mining related environment protection laws. 
3. “For the State to generate adequate revenue through the mining sector and yet have sustainable and equitable development, the implementation machinery needs a tremendous amount of strengthening while the law enforcement machinery needs strict vigilance. Unless the two marry, we will continue to be mute witnesses to the plunder of our natural resources and left wondering how to retrieve an irretrievable situation.”

Judgement 49: State of M.P. and Ors. v. Nandlal Jaiswal and Ors.

Main Contention: 
1. Whether it was obligatory on the part of the competent authority to adopt tender method, failing which the auction method, and then again the fixed license method and so on? Whether the licenses granted created a monopoly in favor of the licencees?
2. Whether the High Court has the power to bifurcate the policy decision and strike down one part of it as bad? Whether Article 14 applies to grant of liquor licenses?

Category: Constitutional Law

Context: The case may touch upon public health and safety considerations, which can have indirect connections to environmental issues. For instance, the environmental implications of large-scale activities, waste management, and noise pollution, may come under scrutiny. The question of whether Article 14 applies to the grant of liquor licenses has implications for the right to equality. In the environmental justice context, equal protection under the law ensures that communities, irrespective of socio-economic factors, have fair access to a clean and healthy environment. Decisions related to licensing should not disproportionately affect certain communities or regions.

2. The State under its regulatory power has the power to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants - its manufacture, storage, export, import, sale and possession. No one can claim as against the State the right to carry on trade or business in liquor and the State cannot be compelled to part with its exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor. But when the State decides to grant such right or privilege to others the State cannot escape the rigour of Article 14. It cannot act arbitrarily or at its sweet will.
3. In the instant case, it is not even the plea of the PIL/Petitioner that he himself has been deprived of his rights. Even in the case of State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal, this Hon'ble Court took the view that the writ petition suffered from latches and thus considered it fit to dismiss it.
4. It was also held that on matters affecting policy and those that require technical expertise, the Court should show deference to, and follow the recommendations of the Committee which is more qualified to address the issues. Learned Attorney General had also relied upon the decision of this Court in the State of M.P. and Ors. v. Nandlal Jaiswal and Ors., wherein this Court had held that whatever observations have been made in regard to the legislation relating to economic matters must apply in regard to executive action in the field of economic activities, though the executive decision may not be placed on as high a pedestal as legislative judgment insofar as judicial deference is concerned.
5. In State of M.P. and Ors. v. Nandlal Jaiswal and Ors. the change of the policy decision taken by the State of Madhya Pradesh to grant licence for construction of distilleries for manufacture and supply of country liquor to existing contractors was challenged.
